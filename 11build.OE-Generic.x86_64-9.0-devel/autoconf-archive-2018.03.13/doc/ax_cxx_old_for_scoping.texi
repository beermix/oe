AX_CXX_OLD_FOR_SCOPING

@majorheading Description

If the compiler accepts the old for scoping rules (the scope of a
variable declared inside the parentheses extends outside the for-body),
define HAVE_OLD_FOR_SCOPING. Note that some compilers (notably g++ and
egcs) support both new and old rules since they accept the old rules and
only generate a warning.
