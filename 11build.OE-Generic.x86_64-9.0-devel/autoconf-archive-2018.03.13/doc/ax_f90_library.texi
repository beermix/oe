@majorheading Description

Set up the compiler flags to link a given fortran 90 library LIBRARY is
the name of the library. LIB-REGEXP is a regular expression (used by
find) matched by the filename of the library, this is useful either if
the library filename does not follow the traditional libxxx.a or
libxxx.so pattern, or if some specific information is embedded into the
name, like compiler used, debugging status ...). FUNCTION-BODY is the
body of a function (including the 'use' statements and the call to a
function defined by the library) SEARCH-PATH is a colon-separated list
of directories that will be used as the base directories for 'find' to
look for the library file. If empty, the search path will be composed of
$prefix/lib, $ac_default_prefix/lib, and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Two output
variables named F90_LDFLAGS_xxx and F90_LIBS_xxx will be set up with the
proper flag for substitution in Makefiles (xxx is built from the first
argument, with autoconf traditional escapes).
