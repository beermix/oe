@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_LAPACK([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

This macro looks for a library that implements the LAPACK linear-algebra
interface (see http://www.netlib.org/lapack/). On success, it sets the
LAPACK_LIBS output variable to hold the requisite library linkages.

To link with LAPACK, you should link with:

@smallexample
  $LAPACK_LIBS $BLAS_LIBS $LIBS $FLIBS
@end smallexample

in that order. BLAS_LIBS is the output variable of the AX_BLAS macro,
called automatically. FLIBS is the output variable of the
AC_F77_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS macro (called if necessary by AX_BLAS), and is
sometimes necessary in order to link with F77 libraries. Users will also
need to use AC_F77_DUMMY_MAIN (see the autoconf manual), for the same
reason.

The user may also use --with-lapack=<lib> in order to use some specific
LAPACK library <lib>. In order to link successfully, however, be aware
that you will probably need to use the same Fortran compiler (which can
be set via the F77 env. var.) as was used to compile the LAPACK and BLAS
libraries.

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a LAPACK library
is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it
is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action
will define HAVE_LAPACK.
