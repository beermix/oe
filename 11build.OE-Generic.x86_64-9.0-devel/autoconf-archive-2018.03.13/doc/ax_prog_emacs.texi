@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_PROG_EMACS
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

This macro allows the end user to specify a particular Emacs executable
via a configure script command-line arg. For example:

@smallexample
  ./configure EMACS=$HOME/build/GNU/emacs/src/emacs
@end smallexample

It also arranges to mention env var EMACS in the './configure --help'
output. See info node "(autoconf) Generic Programs" for details.

More precisely...

If env var EMACS is set, try to use its value directly, but avoid
getting fooled by value 't' (set by older Emacsen for subprocesses). If
no joy from the environment, search for "emacs" via AC_CHECK_PROG. If
still no joy, display "Emacs not found; required!" and make configure
exit failurefully. Otherwise, set shell var EMACS and AC_SUBST it, too.
