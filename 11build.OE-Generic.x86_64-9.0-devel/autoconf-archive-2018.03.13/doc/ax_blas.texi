@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_BLAS([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

This macro looks for a library that implements the BLAS linear-algebra
interface (see http://www.netlib.org/blas/). On success, it sets the
BLAS_LIBS output variable to hold the requisite library linkages.

To link with BLAS, you should link with:

@smallexample
  $BLAS_LIBS $LIBS $FLIBS
@end smallexample

in that order. FLIBS is the output variable of the
AC_F77_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS macro (called if necessary by AX_BLAS), and is
sometimes necessary in order to link with F77 libraries. Users will also
need to use AC_F77_DUMMY_MAIN (see the autoconf manual), for the same
reason.

Many libraries are searched for, from ATLAS to CXML to ESSL. The user
may also use --with-blas=<lib> in order to use some specific BLAS
library <lib>. In order to link successfully, however, be aware that you
will probably need to use the same Fortran compiler (which can be set
via the F77 env. var.) as was used to compile the BLAS library.

ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a BLAS library is
found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it is
not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action will
define HAVE_BLAS.
