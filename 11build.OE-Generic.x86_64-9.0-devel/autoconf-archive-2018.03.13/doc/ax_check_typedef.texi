@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_CHECK_TYPEDEF(TYPEDEF, HEADER [, ACTION-IF-FOUND [, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND ]])
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Check if the given typedef-name is recognized as a type. The trick is to
use a sizeof(TYPEDEF) and see if the compiler is happy with that.

This can be thought of as a mixture of AC_CHECK_TYPE(TYPEDEF,DEFAULT)
and AC_CHECK_LIB(LIBRARY,FUNCTION,ACTION-IF-FOUND,ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND).

A convenience macro AX_CHECK_TYPEDEF_ is provided that will not emit any
message to the user - it just executes one of the actions.
