AX_CHECK_JAVA_PLUGIN(<shell-variable>)
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

This macro sets <shell-variable> to empty on failure and to a compatible
version of plugin.jar otherwise. Directories searched are /usr/java/*
and /usr/local/java/*, which are assumed to be j@{dk,re@} installations.
Apply the shell variable as you see fit. If sun changes things so
<jre>/lib/plugin.jar is not the magic file it will stop working.

This macro assumes that unzip, zipinfo or pkzipc is available (and can
list the contents of the jar archive). The first two are assumed to work
similarly enough to the infozip versions. The pkzipc version is assumed
to work if I understand the documentation on pkware's site but YMMV. I
do not have access to pwkware's version to test it.
