AX_PATH_LIB_PCRE [(A/NA)]
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

check for pcre lib and set PCRE_LIBS and PCRE_CFLAGS accordingly.

also provide --with-pcre option that may point to the $prefix of the
pcre installation - the macro will check $pcre/include and $pcre/lib to
contain the necessary files.

the usual two ACTION-IF-FOUND / ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND are supported and
they can take advantage of the LIBS/CFLAGS additions.
