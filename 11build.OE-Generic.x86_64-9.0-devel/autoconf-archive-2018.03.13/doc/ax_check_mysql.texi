@majorheading Description

Looks for a MySQL installation in typical locations, or can take in a
flag designating where a MySQL installation is found. Sets the variables
stated to various attributes of the desired MySQL installation.

In detail, AX_CHECK_MYSQL will automatically look for a MySQL
installation in the directories that a mysql source or binary install
typically install to. AX_CHECK_MYSQL will throw an error if it cannot
find one, and it is required.

AX_CHECK_MYSQL can also check for specific variables passed regarding a
location of a MySQL installation.

If a MySQL installation is found, AX_CHECK_MYSQL sets variables
regarding the version of MySQL, its architecture (32 or 64 bit), and
wether the version supports Plugins.

AX_CHECK_MYSQL_INSTALL will check a designated root directory for a
command, plugin, and include directory. If a mysql binary is not found
or not found, the IF-FOUND and IF-NOT-FOUND directive will be executed,
respectively.

AX_CHECK_MYSQL adds the following flags:

@smallexample
  --with-mysql, for the root of a desired MySQL installation
  --with-mysql-plugin, for the path to the plugin directory of the MySQL installation
  --with-mysql-include, for the path to the include directory of the MySQL installation
  --with-mysql-command, for the path to the binary directory of the MySQL installation
  --with-mysql-source, for the path to a directory containing the source of the MySQL installation
@end smallexample

AX_CHECK_MYSQL sets:

@smallexample
  MYSQL to indicate whether MySQL was found or not
  MYSQL_INCLUDES to the include directory (if one exists)
  MYSQL_PLUGINS  to the plugin directory
  MYSQL_COMMANDS  to the mysql executable directory
  MYSQL_ARCHITECTURE to whether MySQL is 32 or 64 bit (32 if 32, 64 if 64)
  MYSQL_VERSION to what the MySQL version is (5.1,5.5, etc)
  MYSQL_PLUGIN_OK to whether MySQL version supports plugins (5.1 or greater)
  MYSQL_55 to whether the version of MySQL is 5.5 or greater
  MYSQL_SOURCE  to the source directory passed by --with-mysql-source
