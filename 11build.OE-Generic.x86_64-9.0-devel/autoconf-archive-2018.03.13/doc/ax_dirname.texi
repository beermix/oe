@smallexample
AX_DIRNAME(PATHNAME)
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Parts of the implementation have been taken from AS_DIRNAME from the
main autoconf package in generation 2.5x. However, we do only use "sed"
to cut out the dirname, and we do additionally clean up some dir/..
parts in the resulting pattern.

this macro may be used in autoconf 2.13 scripts as well.
