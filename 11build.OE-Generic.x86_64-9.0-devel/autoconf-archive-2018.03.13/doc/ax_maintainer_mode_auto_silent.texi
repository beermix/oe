AX_MAINTAINER_MODE_AUTO_SILENT
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Set autotools to error/sleep settings so that they are not run when
being erroneously triggered. Likewise make libtool-silent when libtool
has been used.

I use the macro quite a lot since some automake versions have the
tendency to try to rerun some autotools on a mere make even when not
quite in --maintainer-mode. That is very annoying. Likewise, a user who
installs from source does not want to see doubled compiler messages.

I did not put an AC_REQUIRE(MAINTAINER_MODE) in here - should I?
