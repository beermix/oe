@majorheading Description

AX_CONFIG_FEATURE is a simple wrapper for AC_ARG_ENABLE, it enables the
feature FEATURE-NAME and AC_DEFINEs the passed DEFINE, depending on the
user choice. DESCRIPTION will be used for AC_DEFINEs. ACTION-IF-ENABLED
and ACTION-IF-NOT-ENABLED are the actions that will be run. A feature is
enabled by default, in order to change this behaviour use the
AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLED and AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_DISABLED
macros.

A simple example:

@smallexample
  AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLED
  AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_xxxxx, [turns on/off XXXXX support],
                    HAVE_XXXXX, [Define if you want XXXXX support])
@end smallexample

@smallexample
  ...
@end smallexample

@smallexample
  AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_DISABLED
  AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_yyyyy, [turns on/off YYYYY support],
                    HAVE_YYYYY, [Define if you want YYYYY support],
                    [enable_yyyyy="yes"], [enable_yyyyy="no"])
  AM_CONDITIONAL(YYYYY, [test "$enable_yyyyy" = "yes"])
@end smallexample

@smallexample
  AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEFAULT_ENABLED
  AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(...)
@end smallexample

@smallexample
  ...
@end smallexample

If you have lot of features and you want a verbose dumping of each user
selection use AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE. Use AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SILENT in
order to remove a previously AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE. By default
features are silent.

Use AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE or AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DISABLE in order to
enable or disable a specific feature.

Another simple example:

@smallexample
  AS_IF([some_test_here],[AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE(feature_xxxxx)],[])
@end smallexample

@smallexample
  AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_xxxxx, [turns on/off XXXXX support],
                    HAVE_XXXXX, [Define if you want XXXXX support])
  AX_CONFIG_FEATURE(feature_yyyyy, [turns on/off YYYYY support],
                    HAVE_YYYYY, [Define if you want YYYYY support],
                    [enable_yyyyy="yes"], [enable_yyyyy="no"])
@end smallexample

@smallexample
  ...
@end smallexample

NOTE: AX_CONFIG_FEATURE_ENABLE() must be placed first of the relative
AX_CONFIG_FEATURE() macro ...
