@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_FUNC_MKDIR
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Check whether mkdir() is mkdir or _mkdir, and whether it takes one or
two arguments.

This macro can define HAVE_MKDIR, HAVE__MKDIR, and MKDIR_TAKES_ONE_ARG,
which are expected to be used as follows:

@smallexample
  #if HAVE_MKDIR
  #  if MKDIR_TAKES_ONE_ARG
       /* MinGW32 */
  #    define mkdir(a, b) mkdir(a)
  #  endif
  #else
  #  if HAVE__MKDIR
       /* plain Windows 32 */
  #    define mkdir(a, b) _mkdir(a)
  #  else
  #    error "Don't know how to create a directory on this system."
  #  endif
  #endif
@end smallexample
