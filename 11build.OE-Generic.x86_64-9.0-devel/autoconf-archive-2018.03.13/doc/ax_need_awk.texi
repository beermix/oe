@majorheading Description

Check if an awk implementation is available. Bail-out if not found.

This work is heavily based upon testawk.sh script by Heiner Steven. You
should find his script (and related works) at
<http://www.shelldorado.com/articles/awkcompat.html>. Thanks to
Alessandro Massignan for his suggestions and extensive nawk tests on
FreeBSD.
