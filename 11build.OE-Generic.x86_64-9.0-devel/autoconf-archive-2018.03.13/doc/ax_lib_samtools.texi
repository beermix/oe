@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_LIB_SAMTOOLS()
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

This macro searches for an installed samtools library. If nothing was
specified when calling configure, it searches first in /usr/local and
then tries with ld's default library search path. If the
--with-samtools=DIR is specified, it will try to find it in
DIR/include/bam/sam.h and DIR/lib/libbam.a. As a final try it will look
in DIR/sam.h and DIR/libbam.a as the samtools library does not contain
an install rule.

If --without-samtools is specified, the library is not searched at all.

If either the header file (sam.h) or the library (libbam) is not found,
the configuration exits on error, asking for a valid samtools
installation directory or --without-samtools.

The macro defines the symbol HAVE_SAMTOOLS if the library is found. You
should use autoheader to include a definition for this symbol in a
config.h file. Sample usage in a C/C++ source is as follows:

@smallexample
  #ifdef HAVE_SAMTOOLS
  #include <sam.h>
  #endif /* HAVE_SAMTOOLS */
@end smallexample

The following output variables are set with AC_SUBST:

@smallexample
  SAMTOOLS_CPPFLAGS
  SAMTOOLS_LDFLAGS
  SAMTOOLS_LIBS
@end smallexample

You can use them like this in Makefile.am:

@smallexample
  AM_CPPFLAGS = $(SAMTOOLS_CPPFLAGS)
  AM_LDFLAGS = $(SAMTOOLS_LDFLAGS)
  program_LDADD = $(SAMTOOLS_LIBS)
@end smallexample
