@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_RESTORE_FLAGS_WITH_PREFIX(PREFIX, LIST-OF-FLAGS)
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Restore the flags saved by AX_SAVE_FLAGS_WITH_PREFIX.

Expansion example: AX_RESTORE_FLAGS_WITH_PREFIX([GL], [[CFLAGS],[LIBS]])
expands to

@smallexample
  CFLAGS="$gl_saved_flag_cflags"
  LIBS="$gl_saved_flag_libs"
@end smallexample

One common use case is to define a package specific wrapper macro around
this one, and also restore other variables if needed. For example:

@smallexample
  AC_DEFUN([_AX_CHECK_GL_RESTORE_FLAGS], [
    AX_RESTORE_FLAGS_WITH_PREFIX([GL],[$1])
    AC_LANG_POP([C])
  ])
@end smallexample

@smallexample
  # Restores CFLAGS, LIBS and language state
  _AX_CHECK_GL_RESTORE_FLAGS([[CFLAGS],[LIBS]])
@end smallexample
