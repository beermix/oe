@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_VAR_POPVALUE(VARIABLE)
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Restores a variable's previous value. Compile, link and running tests
usually require the programmer to provide additional flags. However, it
is strongly recommended not to override flags defined by the user
through the configure command. AX_VAR_PUSHVALUE and AX_VAR_POPVALUE are
clean way to temporarily store a variable's value and restore it later,
using a stack-like behaviour. This macro supports nesting.

Example:

@smallexample
  AX_VAR_PUSHVALUE([CXXFLAGS],["my test flags"])
  perform some checks with CXXFLAGS...
  CXXFLAGS value will be "my test flags"
  AX_VAR_POPVALUE([CXXFLAGS])
  CXXFLAGS is restored to its original value
@end smallexample
