@majorheading Synopsis

AX_CXX_VAR_PRETTYFUNC
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

This function tries to determine the best C++ macro/identifier that
contains the current function name. Depending on the compiler, this may
be __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ (GCC), __FUNCSIG__ (MSVC), __func__ (C++
standard), __FUNCTION__ (fallback).

The function will define HAVE_PRETTYFUNC if a macro exists, and define
__PRETTYFUNC__ to the best possible macro.  When HAVE_PRETTYFUNC is not
defined, __PRETTYFUNC__ will contain the constant string "<<unknown>>".
