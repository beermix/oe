@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_EXTRA_DIST
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Allow support for custom dist targets.

To add custom dist targets, you must create a dist-<TYPE> target within
your Makefile.am, where <TYPE> is the name of the dist and then add
<TYPE> to EXTRA_SRC_DISTS or EXTRA_BIN_DISTS. For example:

@smallexample
  dist-foobar:
   <rules for making the foobar dist>
@end smallexample

@smallexample
  EXTRA_BIN_DISTS += foobar
@end smallexample

You can then build all the src dist targets by running:

@smallexample
  make dist-src
@end smallexample

You can build all the binary dist targets by running:

@smallexample
  make dist-bin
@end smallexample

and you can build both the src and dist targets by running:

@smallexample
  make all-dist
@end smallexample
