@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_PERL_EXT
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Fetches the linker flags and C compiler flags for compiling and linking
Perl binary extensions.  The macro substitutes PERL_EXT_PREFIX,
PERL_EXT_INC, PERL_EXT_LIB, PERL_EXT_CPPFLAGS, PERL_EXT_LDFLAGS and
PERL_EXT_DLEXT variables if Perl executable was found.  It also checks
the same variables before trying to retrieve them from the Perl
configuration.

@smallexample
  PERL_EXT_PREFIX: top-level perl installation path (--prefix)
  PERL_EXT_INC: XS include directory
  PERL_EXT_LIB: Perl extensions destination directory
  PERL_EXT_CPPFLAGS: C preprocessor flags to compile extensions
  PERL_EXT_LDFLAGS: linker flags to build extensions
  PERL_EXT_DLEXT: extensions suffix for perl modules (e.g. ".so")
@end smallexample

Examples:

@smallexample
  AX_PERL_EXT
  if test x"$PERL" = x; then
     AC_ERROR(["cannot find Perl"])
  fi
@end smallexample
