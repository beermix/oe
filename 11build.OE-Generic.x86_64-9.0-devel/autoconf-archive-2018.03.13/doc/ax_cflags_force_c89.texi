@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_CFLAGS_FORCE_C89 [(shellvar [,default, [A/NA]])]
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Try to find a compiler option that enables strict C89 mode.

For the GNU CC compiler it will be -ansi -pedantic.  The result is added
to the shellvar being CFLAGS by default.

Currently this macro knows about GCC, Solaris C compiler, Digital Unix C
compiler, C for AIX Compiler, HP-UX C compiler, IRIX C compiler, NEC
SX-5 (Super-UX 10) C compiler, and Cray J90 (Unicos 10.0.0.8) C
compiler.

@smallexample
 - $1 shell-variable-to-add-to : CFLAGS
 - $2 add-value-if-not-found : nothing
 - $3 action-if-found : add value to shellvariable
 - $4 action-if-not-found : nothing
@end smallexample

NOTE: These macros depend on AX_APPEND_FLAG.
