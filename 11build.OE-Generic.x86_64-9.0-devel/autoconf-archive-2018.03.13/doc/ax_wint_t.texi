@majorheading Description

It turns out that MacOS X doesn't guarantee to provide the "wint_t" type
unless you include the strange header <runetype.h> in addition to
<wchar.h>. Consequently, the "do I have a system wint_t?" probe fails
and an alternate gets used. Unfortunately, by the time the program gets
built, one way or another that funny header winds up getting included
and the "#define wint_t unsigned int" patch-up-hack mutilates the
typedef. This macro will get it right.
