@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_CHECK_GIRS_GJS(MODULE, API_VERSION [, MODULE, API_VERSION...])
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Check that the GObject Introspection module $MODULE is importable in GJS
(GNOME's JavaScript engine, https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Gjs). The
API version must be $API_VERSION.

GObject Introspection
(https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GObjectIntrospection) is a tool for
generating bindings from C libraries to higher-level languages. The
bindings live in a GObject Introspection repository (GIR) file, which is
what this macro checks.

Note that for the purposes of GObject Introspection, the API version is
different from the release version. For example, GTK currently has API
version 3.0, but that could mean any release from the 3.0, 3.2, 3.4,...
series. To check for specific API that was added in a later version, use
AX_CHECK_GIR_SYMBOLS_GJS.

Example:

@smallexample
  AX_CHECK_GIRS_GJS([Gdk], [3.0],
                    [Gtk], [3.0])
@end smallexample

NOTE: This macro depends on AX_PROG_GJS.
