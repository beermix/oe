AX_VAR_TIMEZONE_EXTERNALS
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Use instead of `AC_STRUCT_TIMEZONE' to determine whether the external
timezone variables `timezone', `altzone' and `daylight' exist, defining
`HAVE_TIMEZONE', `HAVE_ALTZONE' and `HAVE_DAYLIGHT' respectively (as
well as gaining the macros defined by `AC_STRUCT_TIMEZONE').

Rewritten for Autoconf 2.68, and made robust against BSD's timezone()
function, by Daniel Richard G.
