@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG(FLAG, [ACTION-SUCCESS], [ACTION-FAILURE], [EXTRA-FLAGS], [INPUT])
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Check whether the given FLAG works with the current language's compiler
or gives an error.  (Warnings, however, are ignored)

ACTION-SUCCESS/ACTION-FAILURE are shell commands to execute on
success/failure.

If EXTRA-FLAGS is defined, it is added to the current language's default
flags (e.g. CFLAGS) when the check is done.  The check is thus made with
the flags: "CFLAGS EXTRA-FLAGS FLAG".  This can for example be used to
force the compiler to issue an error when a bad flag is given.

INPUT gives an alternative input source to AC_COMPILE_IFELSE.

NOTE: Implementation based on AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION. Please keep this
macro in sync with AX_CHECK_@{PREPROC,LINK@}_FLAG.
