@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_CHECK_CLASSPATH
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

AX_CHECK_CLASSPATH just displays the CLASSPATH, for the edification of
the user.

Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission. The
general documentation, as well as the sample configure.in, is included
in the AX_PROG_JAVA macro.
