@majorheading Description

Test for mpiP: Lightweight, Scalable MPI Profiling
(http://mpip.sourceforge.net/)

Provides a --with-mpiP=DIR option. Searches --with-mpiP location and the
usual places for mpiP and required libraries.  Marks MPIP as a precious
environment variable.

On success, sets MPIP_LDFLAGS, MPIP_LIBS, #defines HAVE_MPIP, and calls
ACTION-IF-FOUND. When ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is not specified, the default
behavior is for configure to fail.
