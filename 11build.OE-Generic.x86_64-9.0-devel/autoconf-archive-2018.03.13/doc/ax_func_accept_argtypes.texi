@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_FUNC_ACCEPT_ARGTYPES
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

Checks the data types of the three arguments to accept(). Results are
placed into the symbols ACCEPT_TYPE_ARG[123], consistent with the
following example:

@smallexample
  #define ACCEPT_TYPE_ARG1 int
  #define ACCEPT_TYPE_ARG2 struct sockaddr *
  #define ACCEPT_TYPE_ARG3 socklen_t *
@end smallexample

This macro requires AC_CHECK_HEADERS to have already verified the
presence or absence of sys/types.h and sys/socket.h.

NOTE: This is just a modified version of the AC_FUNC_SELECT_ARGTYPES
macro. Credit for that one goes to David MacKenzie et. al.
