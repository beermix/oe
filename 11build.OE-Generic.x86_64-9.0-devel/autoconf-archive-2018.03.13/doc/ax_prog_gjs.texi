@majorheading Description

AX_PROG_GJS checks for the presence of the JavaScript interpreter GJS
(https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Gjs) in pkg-config or in the path. If
it is not found, an error is issued and configure is halted. If it is
found, the path of the interpreter is placed into a variable named GJS,
which is declared precious.
