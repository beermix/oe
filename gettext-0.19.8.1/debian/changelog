  * Note: This is a "conservative release" which tries to be nice with
    autobuilders using unstable. After the release of wheezy, the following
    changes will be made: a) Change gettext Depends on the new -dev packages
    to just Recommends, and b) Drop libgettextsrc.so and libgettextlib.so,
    as those libraries are for internal use only and not meant to be used
    by other packages. Those changes will be made *regardless* of this release
    entering wheezy or not. Debian derivatives (like Ubuntu) are welcome to

    - Explicitly configure with --disable-csharp.

gettext (0.18.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added Conflicts: autopoint (<= 0.17-11) to gettext, as the old dummy
    autopoint had a dependency on gettext that should have been versioned
    and the current gettext package no longer contains the autopoint script.
  * Dropped cvs and rcs from Build-Depends. No longer needed.
  * Dropped options --without-cvs and --with-git from ./configure call,
    as those are now the default.
  * Added Build-Depends: libunistring-dev.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 13 Jun 2010 14:34:30 +0200

gettext (0.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * When called with options --statistics and --verbose, msgfmt now prints
    the filename as a prefix of the statistics line. Closes: #320174.
  * Changed 50gettext.el to behave if gettext-el is removed but not purged.
    Thanks to Kevin Ryde. Closes: #422664.
  * Fixed infinite loop in po-previous-translated-entry. Closes: #496944.
  * Makevars now allows passing options for msgmerge. Closes: #538137.
  * autopoint now supports multiple PO directories. Closes: #538150.
  * Upstream includes zh_CN translation. Closes: #559051.
  * Lots of programs now support --color. Closes: #573704.
  * Fixed xgettext problem with perl strings. Closes: #573770.
  * Changed autopoint so that it uses git instead of cvs. As the autopoint
    package was created to avoid gettext to depend on cvs, we are not going
    to make gettext to depend on git now. Moreover, as packages using
    autopoint and still having cvs in their build-depends would not work
    anymore even if autopoint is still kept in the gettext package, this
    effectively puts an end to the transition period: packages using
    autopoint must build-depend on autopoint now.
  * Do the actual move of autopoint stuff to the autopoint package.
  * Applied patch from Bruno Haible to not publicize the builder's name
    and email in the small git repository created for autopoint.
  * Added cvs, rcs and git to build-depends, because of the above.
  * Updated README.Debian to match current status of autopoint package.
  * Removed way obsolete versioned Replaces everywhere, as we don't
    support upgrades which skip releases.

gettext (0.17-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch to 3.0 (quilt) source format, 10 patches.
  * Create an autopoint package. Packages using autopoint should now
    build-depend on it and drop cvs if they don't use it directly.
    After packages have been updated, the autopoint script will actually
    be moved to the autopoint package. This procedure avoids breaking
    affected packages during the transition period.
  * gettext now recommends autopoint, not cvs.
  * Rewrite of README.Debian to match reality.

 -- Matthias Klose <doko@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 18 Jul 2005 20:26:07 +0200

gettext (0.14.5-2ubuntu1) breezy; urgency=low

  * Resynchronize with Debian. Ubuntu 12479.

 -- Matthias Klose <doko@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 18 Jul 2005 16:59:36 +0000

gettext (0.14.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New C++ ABI. gettext-base now Provides: libasprintf0c2.
  * Changed shlibs file accordingly.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Jul 2005 17:30:10 +0200

gettext (0.14.5-1ubuntu2) breezy; urgency=low

  * No change build to cleanup erroneous /usr/share/info/dir.gz on hppa

gettext (0.14.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Jun 2005 19:02:50 +0200

gettext (0.14.4-2ubuntu1) breezy; urgency=low

  * Disable jikes-classpath and gcj dependancies for now.  Will
    reenable these when they're available in main.

 -- Jeff Bailey <jbailey@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 18 May 2005 19:48:40 +0000

gettext (0.14.4-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Moved libgettextpo from gettext-base to gettext, where it belongs.
    As libgettextpo depends on libgettextlib, which is in gettext, this
    should remove an undeclared (and undesired) dependency of
    gettext-base on gettext (Closes: #307749). The blender package
    should work again if their dependencies are installed.
    Thanks to Steve Langasek for the report.
  * Moved Provides: libgettextpo0 from gettext-base to gettext.
  * gettext now Replaces: gettext-base (<= 0.14.4-1).
  * Moved the libgettextpo bit of shlibs in gettext-base to gettext.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu,  5 May 2005 17:02:08 +0200

gettext (0.14.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Apr 2005 16:00:18 +0200

gettext (0.14.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added watch file.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu, 31 Mar 2005 19:11:02 +0200

gettext (0.14.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream (bugfix) release.
  * The Debian diff is small again.
  * The copyright file is now in UTF-8.
  * A lot of files have relaxed licensing terms.
  * Improved manual about eval_gettext (Closes: #279992).
  * gettext.sh is now both a shell function library and a shell script,
    so /usr/share/gettext/gettext.sh is dropped (Closes: #292759).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Mar 2005 15:16:28 +0100

gettext (0.14.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed dependency on libgcj4 by not using gcj anymore (Closes: #292988).
  * Added "curl | wget | lynx" to the Recommends field and disabled GetURL
    call from urlget.c. This should be a better fix for Bug#244215.
  * gettext now includes gettext.jar for java development.
    For this to work, you will need a Java Virtual Machine.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Feb 2005 18:18:22 +0100

gettext (0.14.1-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed gettext.sh to be a symlink to /usr/share/gettext/gettext.sh.
  * Changed architecture-dependent build-dependencies to be inclusive
    rather than exclusive, to not break unreleased architectures.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue,  1 Feb 2005 18:29:02 +0100

gettext (0.14.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added java support, using jikes-classpath and also gcj when available.
  * Weird java error from msginit should now be gone (Closes: #244215).
  * gettext-base now provides libintl.jar (Closes: #259730).
  * Debian changelog is now in UTF-8.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 22 Jan 2005 20:21:12 +0100

gettext (0.14.1-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed remaining vulnerability in autopoint, where temporary directories
    were created using an unknown umask (Closes: #286392).
    Patch by Bruno Haible. Thanks to Javier for the report.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Jan 2005 17:55:30 +0100

gettext (0.14.1-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed xgettext misparsing of perl source (Closes: #269059).
    Patch by Guido Flohr, approved by Bruno Haible.
  * Added Suggests: gettext-doc to gettext (Closes: #270886).
  * Improved description of gettext-doc (Bug #270886 also).
  * Fixed gettextize and autopoint insecure behaviour regarding
    temp files (Closes: #278283). This is CAN-2004-0966.
    Patch by Mark J. Cox, slightly modified by Martin Pitt.
    The patch hardcodes `:' as the PATH separator, so it will not work
    on non-Unix Debian architectures (sorry), but should be good enough
    for the 11 architectures in sarge, the Hurd and the *BSDs.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Oct 2004 19:21:30 +0200

gettext (0.14.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed Tag Table in info file. If this does not fix Bug #260048,
    install-info should find a better excuse to fail.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Jul 2004 18:36:10 +0200

gettext (0.14.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed info file (Closes: #260048).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Jul 2004 13:39:06 +0200

gettext (0.14.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simplified Build-Depends. Now glibc is required to be >= 2.2 by using
    a run-time test. This will break autobuilders still running potato.
  * Improved ABOUT-NLS wording (Closes: #239456).
  * Updated manual regarding python bug (Closes: #246334).
  * Updated gettext-tools/projects/TP/teams.html (Closes: #248224).
  * Relibtoolized with libtool 1.5.6-1 (Closes: #258178).
  * Added README.Debian (Closes: #258433).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Jul 2004 19:11:02 +0200

gettext (0.14.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added libexpat1-dev to Build-Depends, for glade support.
  * Added libc0.1-dev to Build-Depends, for GNU/kFreeBSD.
  * Removed special-casing of knetbsd-gnu in debian/rules.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Mar 2004 17:40:02 +0100

gettext (0.14.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, relibtoolized with libtool 1.5.2-1,
    autoconf 2.59-2 and automake 1.8.2-1.
  * Added --disable-csharp to ./configure call, just in case.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Feb 2004 17:31:34 +0100

gettext (0.13.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed xgettext, which sometimes does not print comments found in
    source files. Patch by Bruno Haible (Closes: #227339).
  * Fixed msginit, which segfaults if input file has no header.
    Patch by Bruno Haible (Closes: #227652).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jan 2004 19:47:48 +0100

gettext (0.13.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Relibtoolized with libtool 1.5-8, autoconf 2.59-1 and automake 1.7.9-3.
    This should ensure a correct build under all architectures, but it also
    prevents libgettextsrc being linked against the previously installed
    libgettextlib, otherwise we would need a Build-Conflicts: gettext.
  * Added libc1-dev (>= 2.2) to Build-Depends, for GNU/K*BSD systems.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Jan 2004 14:24:04 +0100

gettext (0.12.1-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * gettext-base now Replaces: gettext (<= 0.12.1-1), since libasprintf
    shared library was present on gettext_0.12.1-1 (Closes: #216406).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 2003 19:04:48 +0200

gettext (0.12.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified two Makefile.in files so that install-info is never called
    during the build, to prevent /usr/share/info/dir.gz to appear.
  * Added -D_REENTRANT to CFLAGS, since there are libraries here.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Oct 2003 13:03:06 +0200

gettext (0.12.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated libtool stuff using Debian libtool_1.5-2, required by ARM.
    Version 1.5-1 used in gettext_0.12.1-4 did not really work.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Sep 2003 12:10:36 +0200

gettext (0.12.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Strip static libraries using --strip-debug.
  * Strategically touch files in the build target to convince make that
    no file does really need to be regenerated using automake or autoconf.
  * While we are at it, the warning about autoheader should disappear too.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Sep 2003 22:54:34 +0200

gettext (0.12.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reorganized debian/rules almost entirely.
  * Added ABOUT-NLS to /usr/share/doc/gettext-base.
  * Updated libtool stuff using Debian libtool. I expected this would allow
    the build-dependency on file to be removed, but I was wrong, see 0.12.1-6.
    Note: The size of the diff is not an error, it's the result of updating
    everything to not build-depend on autoconf either.
  * autopoint should now parse intl/VERSION correctly (Closes: #204384).
    Patch by Denis Barbier.
  * Restored libasprintf and libgettextpo shared libraries (closes: #209398),
    which should now be handled in a more orthodox way, namely:
  - Added a shlibs file to gettext-base.
  - gettext-base provides libasprintf0 and libgettextpo0.
  - gettext provides libasprintf-dev and libgettextpo-dev.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri, 12 Sep 2003 17:13:08 +0200

gettext (0.12.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added file to Build-Depends. This should now build under ARM.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Jul 2003 13:11:04 +0200

gettext (0.12.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified autoconf-lib-link/m4/lib-prefix.m4 to prevent a duplicate
    macro definition problem. Patch by Bruno Haible (Closes: #196648).
  * Added build-dependency on automake1.7, because of the above.
  * Removed shared libraries libasprintf and libgettextpo. For now, only
    the static libraries will be supported.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Jul 2003 19:00:18 +0200

gettext (0.12.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. gettext is now two packages in one.
    Debian gettext-base is upstream gettext-runtime, and Debian gettext
    is upstream gettext-tools (approximately). BTW, gettext-base is much
    smaller than before because message catalogs have been splitted.
  * Moved section 3 manpages from gettext to gettext-base, as recommended
    by PACKAGING. Updated Replaces: field accordingly.
  * mkinstalldirs is now in sync with archive.tar.gz (Closes: #157097).
  * autopoint uses func_fatal_error, not fatal_error (Closes: #158383).
  * autopoint needs cvs, so gettext Suggests: it (Closes: #166477).
  * If the m4 dir is an absolute path, ignore it (Closes: #192159).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Jun 2003 21:47:08 +0200

gettext (0.11.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Noteworthy changes:
  - There are now two shared libraries on which many of the tools depend,
    but there will be no shlibs file, or -dev package, or static libraries
    because the libraries are undocumented and for internal use only.
  - A file called libintl.jar was supposed to be created during the build,
    but gcj is excluded as a valid Java compiler, so to ensure that the
    package is built in exactly the same way on every architecture, there
    is now a Build-Conflicts: java-compiler. Sorry.
  - There is now a much improved manual. Interested parties are strongly
    encouraged to (re-)read it. In particular, people using gettextize on a
    regular basis should consider using the new `autopoint' tool instead.
  - Since there are now upstream manpages, the old ones are removed from
    the debian directory.
  * The following bugs in 0.10.40 are now fixed:
  - po-mode can now open a new .po file using emacs21 (Bug #137353).
  - xgettext -D does no longer break -j (Bug #147341).
  - Manual is clarified about xgettext and .pot extension (Bug #147624).
  - po-mode accepts mailing lists not at @li.org (Bugs #149137 and #154580).
  * More info at /usr/share/doc/gettext/NEWS.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Aug 2002 11:30:28 +0200

gettext (0.10.40-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made gettext-el prerm and postinst fault-tolerant, since emacsen-common
    is not. Should allow upgrades from woody.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Jul 2002 18:20:02 +0200

gettext (0.10.40-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * gettext does no longer depend on gettext-el.
  * gettext-el now depends on emacsen.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 20 Jul 2002 13:21:24 +0200

gettext (0.10.40-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Hurd ABI. Changed libc0.2-dev to libc0.3-dev in Build-Depends.
    Closes: #144562.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Apr 2002 13:45:18 +0200

gettext (0.10.40-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Modified /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50gettext.el so that it only uses
    modify-coding-system-alist when it's actually ok to do so.
    This closes: #110416 (xemacs21) and also closes: #141446 (emacs19).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Apr 2002 13:17:42 +0200

gettext (0.10.40-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Moved po-mode support to a new package, gettext-el. For now, gettext
    depends on it to ensure smooth upgrades from potato regardless of
    the upgrade method, but this dependency will be dropped after the
    release of woody.
  * Removed the dependency on emacsen-common while gettext still depends
    on gettext-el. This should be safe enough because emacsen-common is
    now more robust, but it is some sort of compromise. After the release
    of woody, gettext-el will depend on emacsen (not emacsen-common),
    to be in full compliance with debian emacs policy.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Mar 2002 13:00:12 +0100

gettext (0.10.40-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified prerm to be fault-tolerant regarding prerm scripts in
    previous gettext releases which did not depend on emacsen-common yet.
    This is possible because dpkg executes the new prerm if the old one fails.
    Should fix a bug which has been reported a lot of times.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Feb 2002 17:44:42 +0100

gettext (0.10.40-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. The normal install target
    is used again, passing both INSTALL_PROGRAM and INSTALL_SCRIPT.
  * Moved ngettext and ngettext(1) to gettext-base. Updated Replaces.
  * Added dependency on emacsen-common (Closes: #48681, #65320).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat,  2 Feb 2002 16:24:28 +0100

gettext (0.10.40-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. libintl is now under LGPL, not GPL.

gettext (0.10.39-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Put new manpages where they belong (Closes: #107651).

gettext (0.10.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Jul 2001 18:45:26 +0200

gettext (0.10.38-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * According to the Debian diff, aclocal.m4 is modified and then some files
    in the `m4' subdirectory, in that order. This may make aclocal.m4 to be
    regenerated during the build, but the `missing' script is unable to handle
    that if automake is not present. Instead of adding a Build-Depends,
    debian/rules now touches aclocal.m4 in the build target (Closes: #104746).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Jul 2001 16:43:30 +0200

gettext (0.10.38-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added libc6.1-dev (>= 2.2) to Build-Depends for alpha and ia64.
    Thanks to Matt Taggart for the report.
  * Rightly refer to the GNU *General* Public License in the documentation.
    Reported by André Dahlqvist (Closes: #102237).
  * Modified 50gettext.el to tell Emacs how to determine automatically the
    coding system of every PO file. (Closes: #103530).
    Thanks to Gaute B Strokkenes for the report.

gettext (0.10.38-1) unstable; urgency=low

gettext (0.10.36-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Registered HTML docs using doc-base (Closes: #63379).
  * Added manpages for every executable (Closes: #92200, #92201).
    Thanks a lot to Michael Piefel for contributing them.
  * Applied two patches from Bruno Haible:
  - Workaround an automake-1.4 bug (Closes: #93119).
  - Removed undeclared build-dependency on itself (Closes: #93275).

gettext (0.10.36-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. It should fix the following bugs:
  - Documentation is now more accurate (Closes: #28696).
  - DESTDIR is now supported (Closes: #38414, #41823, #52571, #85311).
  - gettextize now prints the right aclocal directory (Closes: #38935, #52858).
  - intl/Makefile.in removes libintl.h upon clean (Closes: #56039).
  - gettextize now checks for $gettext_dir before using it (Closes: #69519).
  - Norwegian Nynorsk is now "nn" (Closes: #87735).
  * Added the file NEWS to the doc directory.
  * Removed build-dependency on texinfo, since the .texi is now untouched.
  * glibc >= 2.2 is now required for the build, to avoid the creation of
    a shared libintl library with features not included in libc.
  * No more ./configure --with-included-gettext. This is also required
    to avoid the shared library.

        * only package been provided right now from the gettext
        sources is the gettext package.
