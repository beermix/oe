* Delete irrelevant files:
  * Build systems for irrelevant operating systems.
  * Unmaintained example and test programs.
  * Unsupported contributed files (many unmaintained):
    * Assembly code.
    * Language bindings.
    * Examples.
  * Unused old files (marked as such).
  * (And much more miscellaneous cruft)
* Use standard C:
  * Remove local keyword (#define local static).
  * Replace K&R function prototypes with ANSI function prototypes.
  * Replace Z_NULL with NULL.
  * Replace z_const with const.
  * Assume stdarg is available.
* Remove useless types:
  * Byte (unsigned char), uInt (unsigned int), uLong (unsigned long).
  * Bytef (Byte FAR), charf (char FAR), intf (int FAR), uIntf (uInt FAR),
    uLongf (uLong FAR).
  * voidp (void *), voidpf (void FAR *), voidpc (const void *).
  * uch (unsigned char), ush (unsigned short), usl (unsigned short).
  * uchf (uch FAR), ushf (ush FAR), uslf (usl FAR).
* Use standard library:
  * Assume the standard library and headers are available.
  * Don't provide function prototypes if the standard headers forgets to do it.
  * Don't provide SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and SEEK_END if stdio.h didn't.
  * Replace zmemzero with memset.
  * Replace zmemcpy with memcpy.
  * Replace zmemcmp with memcmp.
  * Replace zstrerror with strerror.
* Require functional toolchain:
  * Remove support for buggy, silly and unhappy compilers.
  * Remove support for debuggers that can't deal with static symbols.
* Remove support for troublesome platforms:
  * Remove support for 16-bit platforms.
  * Remove work-arounds for Windows.
  * Remove work-arounds for Windows CE (UNDER_CE).
* Remove bug compatibility:
  * Remove NO_DUMMY_DECL configuration.
  * Remove PKZIP_BUG_WORKAROUND configuration.
  * Remove INFLATE_ALLOW_INVALID_DISTANCE_TOOFAR_ARRR.
  * Remove !INFLATE_STRICT configuration.
* Remove special configurations:
  * Remove ASMINF configuration.
  * Remove ASMV configuration.
  * Remove BUILDFIXED configuration.
  * Remove DYNAMIC_CRC_TABLE configuration.
  * Remove FASTEST configuration.
  * Remove MAXSEG_64K configuration.
  * Remove NO_DEFLATE and NO_GZCOMPRESS configurations.
  * Remove SYS16BIT configuration.
  * Remove UNALIGNED_OK configuration.
  * Remove NO_DIVIDE configuration.
  * Remove ZLIB_WINAPI configuration.
  * Remove Z_PREFIX configuration.
  * Remove Z_SOLO configuration.
  * Remove !GZIP and !GUNZIP configurations.
* Adopt safer practices:
  * Unconditionally use vsnprintf (refuse to use vsprintf as a fallback).
  * Remove support for thread-unsafely generating tables on first use.
  * Use the system allocator for both if either zalloc or zfree is unset to avoid
    mixing allocators.
  * Replace ZALLOC(), ZFREE() and TRY_FREE() macros with replacement functions
    that check for multiplication overflow and doesn't trust user allocators to
    deal safely with more than UINT_MAX bytes.
  * Use asprintf where appropriate.
  * Better whether-this-value-fits-in-that-type checks.
  * Saturate instead of overflow in deflateBound and compressBound.
* Miscellaneous changes:
  * Remove uses of the register keyword.
  * Remove EQUAL macro.
  * Remove ERR_RETURN macro and inline uses of it.
  * Remove PUP() macro and do post-pointer-read-increment normally.
  * Move code that generates C headers out of the core files and into utilities.
  * Assume attribute visibility hidden is available.
  * Improved large file support compatibility.
  * Simplify adler32 code.
