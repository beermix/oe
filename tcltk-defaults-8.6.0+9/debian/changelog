tcltk-defaults (8.6.0+4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added conflicts and replaces headers for libtcl-dev and libtk-dev (with
    tcl-dev and tk-dev respectively) to make the packages upgradable from
    versions in stable (closes: #720464).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Aug 2013 10:13:38 +0400

tcltk-defaults (8.6.0+3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Restored tcl-dev and tk-dev dummy packages for better backward
    compatibility.

    version restrictions).

 -- Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Aug 2013 22:12:11 +0400

tcltk-defaults (8.6.0+2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Converted to 3.0 (native) source package format.
  * Changed version scheme from 8.6.0-2 to 8.6.0+2 because the former
    violates Debian policy (section 5.6.12).
  * Removed lintian overrides.
  * Don't use the alternatives mechanism for selecting the default Tcl/Tk
    version. Use plain symlinks instead. This includes removing all tclsh
    and wish alternatives in the preinst scripts (closes: #628179).
  * Renamed tcl-dev and tk-dev packages to libtcl-dev and libtk-dev
    (providing the former as virtual packages for backward compatibility).
  * Updated conflicts with tcl/tk 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 packages to the
    latest versions which stil use alternatives.
  * Provide tclsh and wish virtual packages (by tcl and tk respectively)
    for backward compatibility with the older Tcl/Tk policy recommendations.
  * Rewritten debian/rules to make it work more like a Makefile than like a
    series of shell scripts.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.9.4.
  * Increased debhelper compatibility version to 9.
  * Added multi-arch support.
  * Bumped compatible Tcl/Tk version to 8.6.0-2.
  * Removed tcl from the tk dependencies because the tclsh is not necessary
    for a windowed applications or shell to run.
  * Added conflicts and replaces tk-tile headers to the tcl-dev package,
    acknowledging NMU.

tcltk-defaults (8.5.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload of 8.5 to unstable (closes: #515984).
  * Changed symlink targets for /usr/lib/tclConfig.sh and /usr/lib/tkConfig.sh
    to /usr/lib/tcl8.5/tclConfig.sh and /usr/lib/tk8.5/tkConfig.sh because
    the latter files are architecture dependent.
  * Added ${misc:Depends} to the binary packages dependency lists because
    the package is built using debhelper.
  * Bumped standards version to 3.9.1. No changes.

  [ Sergei Golovan ]

    manpage.

  [ Francesco Paolo Lovergine ]

  * Bumped standards version to 3.7.3.
