NAME
----
pixz - parallel, indexed xz compressor

SYNOPSIS
--------
*pixz* ['OPTIONS'] ['INPUT' ['OUTPUT']]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
pixz compresses and decompresses files using multiple processors. If the input looks like a tar(1) archive, it also creates an index of all the files in the archive. This allows the extraction of only a small segment of the tarball, without needing to decompress the entire archive.

OPTIONS
-------
By default, pixz uses standard input and output, unless 'INPUT' and 'OUTPUT' arguments are provided. If pixz is provided with input but no output, it will delete the input once it's done.

*-d*::
  Decompress, instead of compress.

*-t*::
  Force non-tarball mode. By default, pixz auto-detects tar data, and if found enters tarball mode.
  When compressing in non-tarball mode, no archive index will be created. When decompressing, fast extraction will not be available.

*-l*::
  List the archive contents. In tarball mode, lists the files in the tarball. In non-tarball mode, lists the blocks of compressed data.

*-x* 'PATH'::
  Extract certain members from an archive, quickly. All members whose path begins with 'PATH' will be extracted.

*-i* 'INPUT'::
  Use 'INPUT' as the input.

*-o* 'OUTPUT'::
  Use OUTPUT as the output.

*-#*::
  Set compression level, from -0 (lowest compression, fastest) to -9 (highest compression, slowest).

*-e*::
  Use "extreme" compression, which is much slower and only yields a marginal decrease in size.

*-p* 'CPUS'::
  Set the number of CPU cores to use. By default pixz will use the number of cores on the system.

*-f* 'FRACTION'::
  Set the size of each compression block, relative to the LZMA dictionary size (default is 2.0). Higher values give better compression ratios, but use more memory and make random access less efficient. Values less than 1.0 aren't very efficient.

*-q* 'SIZE'::
  Set the number of blocks to allocate for the compression queue (default is 1.3 * cores + 2, rounded up). Higher values give better throughput, up to a point, but use more memory. Values less than the number of cores will make some cores sit idle.

*-h*::
  Show pixz's online help.

EXAMPLES
--------
`pixz < myfile > myfile.xz`::

  Compress a file with pixz.

`pixz myfile`::

  Compress to myfile.pxz, removing the original.

`tar -Ipixz -cf output.tpxz directory`::

  Make tar use pixz for compression.

`pixz -x path/to/file < input.tpxz | tar x`::

  Extract one file from an archive, quickly.
