			<h2 style="margin-top: 0">Your support is appreciated!</h2>
			<p>If you would like to support the development of, technical assistance with, and continued availability of DisplayCAL and Argyll CMS, please consider a financial contribution.
			As DisplayCAL wouldn't be useful without Argyll CMS, all contributions received for DisplayCAL will be split between both projects.<br />
			For light personal non-commercial use, a one-time contribution may be appropriate.
			If you're using DisplayCAL professionally, an annual or monthly contribution would make a great deal of difference in ensuring that both projects continue to be available.</p>
			<p>If you have decided to contribute (many thanks!), but you'd like to give to <a href="http://argyllcms.com">Argyll CMS</a> directly on your own behalf (visit <a href="http://argyllcms.com">argyllcms.com</a> and scroll down a bit to get to its contribution links), please leave a message on your DisplayCAL contribution if contributing to both projects. Please note that if your contribution should be put towards adding a certain feature in Argyll CMS, like support for a specific instrument, it will be more appropriate and efficient to <a href="http://argyllcms.com">contribute to Argyll CMS only</a>, and directly.</p>

			<h2>About DisplayCAL</h2>		

			<p>DisplayCAL is a graphical user interface developed by Florian Höch for the display calibration and profiling tools of <a href="http://argyllcms.com">Argyll CMS</a>, an open source color management system developed by Graeme Gill.</p>

			<p>Calibrate and characterize your display devices using one of the <a href="#instruments">many supported hardware sensors</a>, with support for multi-display setups and a variety of available settings like customizable whitepoint, luminance, tone response curve as well as the option to create matrix and look-up-table ICC profiles, with optional gamut mapping, as well as some proprietary 3D LUT formats. Other features include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Support of colorimeter correction for different screens via <em>correction matrices</em> or <em>calibration specral sample</em> files (the latter only for specific colorimeters i.e. i1 Display Pro, ColorMunki Display and Spyder 4/5).</li>
				<li>Profile verification and measurement report: Check the quality of profiles and 3D LUTs via measurements. Also supports custom CGATS files (e.g. FOGRA, GRACoL/IDEAlliance, SWOP) and using of reference profiles to obtain test values.</li>
				<li>Test chart editor: Create charts with any amount of color patches, easy copy &amp; paste from CGATS, CSV files (only tab-delimited) and spreadsheet applications.</li>
				<li>Create synthetic ICC (matrix) profiles with custom primaries, white- and blackpoint as well as tone response.</li>
			</ul>

						<p>Packages made for older distributions may work on newer distributions as long as nothing substantial has changed (i.e. Python version). Also there are several distributions out there that are based on one in the above list (e.g. Linux Mint which is based on Ubuntu). This means that packages for that base distribution should also work on derivatives, you just need to know which version the derivative is based upon and pick your download accordingly.</p>

						<p>In all other cases, you can try this universal install that should work on a multitude of distributions (if you use it, please uninstall any already installed version of DisplayCAL first to avoid file conflicts):</p>

					<h3>Brief introduction to Zero Install</h3>
					<div>
						<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> Usually you do not have to install Zero Install separately, it is handled automatically by the DisplayCAL downloads linked below. The following paragraph is only informational.)</p>
						<p><a href="http://0install.net">Zero Install</a> is a decentralised cross-platform software installation system. The benefits you get from Zero Install are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Always up-to-date.</strong> Zero Install automatically keeps all software updated.</li>
							<li><strong>Easily switch between software versions</strong> from within Zero Install if desired.</li>
							<li><strong>No administrator rights needed</strong> to add or update software (*).</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="footnote">* Note: Installing/updating Zero Install itself or software dependencies through the operating system's mechanisms may require administrative privileges.</p>

							<li><strong>The version number in the package name does not necessarily reflect the DisplayCAL version</strong>.</li>
							<!--li><strong>An official Argyll CMS version from ArgyllCMS.com will be used by default</strong> unless the distribution-packaged version is newer, but you can switch to a distribution-packaged version anytime (see <a href="#zeroinstall-updating">“Updating or switching between software versions”</a> below).</li-->
						</ul>

						<p>Packages made for older distributions may work on newer distributions as long as nothing substantial has changed (i.e. Python version). Also there are several distributions out there that are based on one in the above list (e.g. Linux Mint which is based on Ubuntu). This means that packages for that base distribution should also work on derivatives, you just need to know which version the derivative is based upon and pick your download accordingly. In all other cases, please try the instructions below or one of the <a href="#standalone">standalone installations</a>.</p>
						
						<h4>Alternate installation method</h4>
						
						<p>If your distribution is not listed above, please follow these instructions:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Install the <strong>0install</strong> or <strong>zeroinstall-injector</strong> package from your distribution. In case it is not available, there are pre-compiled <a href="http://0install.net/tools/0install.xml">generic binaries</a>. Download the appropriate archive for your system, unpack it, <code>cd</code> to the extracted folder in a terminal, and run <code>sudo ./install.sh local</code> to install to /usr/local, or <code>./install.sh home</code> to install to your home directory (you may have to add ~/bin to your PATH variable in that case). You'll need libcurl installed (most systems have it by default).</li>
							<li>Choose the <strong>0install</strong> entry from the applications menu (older versions of Zero Install will have an “Add New Program” entry instead).</li>
							<li>Drag <a href="https://displaycal.net/0install/DisplayCAL.xml">DisplayCAL's Zero Install feed</a> link to the Zero Install window.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>Note on DisplayCAL's standalone tools under Linux (3D LUT maker, curve viewer, profile information, synthetic profile creator, testchart editor, VRML to X3D converter): If using the alternate installation method, an application icon entry will only be created for DisplayCAL itself. This is currently a limitation of Zero Install under Linux. You can manually install icon entries for the standalone tools by running the following in a terminal:</p>
						<pre><code>0launch --command=install-standalone-tools-icons \<br />	https://displaycal.net/0install/DisplayCAL.xml</code></pre>
						<p>And you may uninstall them again with:</p>
						<pre><code>0launch --command=uninstall-standalone-tools-icons \<br />	https://displaycal.net/0install/DisplayCAL.xml</code></pre>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<h4>Linux</h4>
								<p>Choose the <strong>0install</strong> entry from the applications menu (older versions of Zero Install will have a “Manage Programs” entry instead). In the window that opens, right-click the DisplayCAL icon and select “Choose versions” (with older versions of Zero Install, you have to click the small “Update or change version” icon below the “Run” button instead). You can then click the “Refresh all” button to update, or click the small button to the right of an entry and select “Show versions”.</p>
								<p>To select a specific software version, click on the version entry and set the rating to “preferred” (note that this will prevent updates being downloaded for the selected software until you manually change to a different version or reset the rating).</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>Mac OS X</h4>
								<p>Run the <strong>0install Launcher</strong>. In the window that opens, click the “Refresh all” button to update, or click the small button to the right of an entry and select “Show versions”.</p>
								<p>To select a specific software version, click on the version entry and set the rating to “preferred” (note that this will prevent updates being downloaded for the selected software until you manually change to a different version or reset the rating).</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>Windows</h4>
								<p>Choose the <strong>Zero Install</strong> entry from the start page under Windows 8, or the respective subfolder of the programs folder in the start menu under Windows 10, Windows 7 and earlier, and switch to the “My Applications” tab in the window that opens. Click the small “down” arrow inside the “Start” button to the right of the DisplayCAL entry and choose “Update” or “Select version”.</p>
								<p>To select a specific software version, click on the “change” link next to an item, then click on the version entry and set the rating to “preferred” (note that this will prevent updates being downloaded for the selected software until you manually change to a different version or reset the rating).</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Launch DisplayCAL. If it cannot find Argyll CMS on your computer, it will prompt you to automatically download the latest version or select the location manually.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p class="info"><strong>Windows only:</strong> If your measurement device is <strong>not</strong> a ColorMunki Display, i1 Display Pro, Huey, ColorHug, specbos, spectraval or K-10, you need to install an Argyll-specific driver before continuing (the specbos, spectraval and K-10 may require the <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">FTDI virtual COM port driver</a> instead). Select “Install Argyll CMS instrument drivers...” from the “Tools” menu. See also <a href="#install-windows-driver">“Instrument driver installation under Windows”.</a></p>
					<p class="info"><strong>Mac OS X only:</strong> If you want to use the HCFR colorimeter, follow the instructions in the “HCFR Colorimeter” section under “<a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/Installing_OSX.html">Installing Argyll CMS on Mac OS X</a>” in the Argyll CMS documentation before continuing.</p>
					<p>Connect your measurement device to your computer.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Click the small icon with the swirling arrow <img src="theme/refresh_lr.png" alt="" /> in between the “Display device” and “Instrument” controls to detect connected display devices and instruments. The detected instrument(s) should show up in the “Instrument” dropdown.</p>
					<p class="info"><strong>If your measurement device is a Spyder 2</strong>, a popup dialog will show which will let you enable the device. This is required to be able to use the Spyder 2 with Argyll CMS and DisplayCAL.</p>
					<p class="info"><strong>If your measurement device is a i1 Display 2, i1 Display Pro, ColorMunki Display, DTP94, Spyder 2/3/4/5</strong>, a popup dialog will show and allow you to import generic <a href="#colorimeter-corrections">colorimeter corrections</a> from the vendor software which may help measurement accuracy on the type of display you're using. After importing, they are available under the “Correction” dropdown, where you can choose one that fits the type of display you have, or leave it at “Auto” if there is no match. <em>Note:</em> Importing from the Spyder 4/5 software enables additional measurement modes for that instrument.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Click <strong>“Calibrate &amp; profile”</strong>. That's it!</p>
					<p>Feel free to check out the <a href="https://displaycal.net/wiki/">Wiki</a> for guides and tutorials, and refer to the <a href="#concept">documentation</a> for advanced usage instructions (optional).</p>
					<p class="info"><strong>Linux only:</strong> If you can't access your instrument, choose “Install Argyll CMS instrument configuration files...” from the “Tools” menu (if that menu item is grayed out, the Argyll CMS version you're currently using has probably been installed from the distribution's repository and should already be setup correctly for instrument access). If you still cannot access the instrument, try unplugging and reconnecting it, or a reboot. If all else fails, read “<a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/Installing_Linux.html">Installing Argyll CMS on Linux: Setting up instrument access</a>” in the Argyll CMS documentation.</p>

				<p>Note that the <em>i1 Display Pro</em> and <em>i1 Pro</em> are very different instruments despite their naming similarities.</p>

				<p>Also there are currently (2014-05-20) five instruments (or rather, packages) under the ColorMunki brand, two of which are spectrometers, and three are colorimeters (not all of them being recent offerings, but you should be able to find them used in case they are no longer sold new):</p>

					<li>The <em>ColorMunki Design</em> and <em>ColorMunki Photo</em> spectrometers differ only in the functionality of the bundled vendor software. There are no differences between the instruments when used with Argyll CMS and DisplayCAL.</li>
					<li>The <em>ColorMunki Display</em> colorimeter is a less expensive version of the i1 Display Pro colorimeter.

				<h3>Additional requirements for unattended calibration and profiling</h3>

				<p>When using a spectrometer that is supported by the unattended feature (see below), having to take the instrument off the screen to do a sensor self-calibration again after display calibration before starting the measurements for profiling may be avoided if the menu item “Allow skipping of spectrometer self-calibration” under the “Advanced” sub-menu in the “Options” menu is checked (colorimeter measurements are always unattended because they generally do not require a sensor calibration away from the screen, with the exception of the i1 Display 1).</p>

				<p>Unattended calibration and profiling currently supports the following spectrometers in addition to most colorimeters:</p>

					<h4>Additional setup commands</h4>
					<div class="info">
						<dl>
							<dt><code>0install</code></dt>
								<dd>Create/update 0install feeds and create Mac OS X application bundles to run those feeds.</dd>

							<dt><code>bdist_appdmg</code> (Mac OS X only)</dt>
								<dd>Creates a DMG of previously created (by the py2app or bdist_standalone commands) application bundles, or if used together with the <code>0install</code> command.</dd>
							<dt><code>bdist_deb</code> (Linux/Debian-based)</dt>
								<dd>Create an installable Debian (.deb) package, much like the standard distutils command bdist_rpm for RPM packages. Prerequisites:
								You first need to install alien and rpmdb, create a dummy RPM database via <code>sudo rpmdb --initdb</code>, then edit (or create from scratch) the setup.cfg (you can have a look at misc/setup.ubuntu9.cfg for a working example). Under Ubuntu, running utils/dist_ubuntu.sh will automatically use the correct setup.cfg. If you are using Ubuntu 11.04 or any other debian-based distribution which has Python 2.7 as default, you need to edit /usr/lib/python2.7/distutils/command/bdist_rpm.py, and change the line <code>install_cmd = ('%s install <span style="color: #c00">-O1</span> --root=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT '</code> to <code>install_cmd = ('%s install --root=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT '</code> by removing the <code><span style="color: #c00">-O1</span></code> flag. Also, you need to change /usr/lib/rpm/brp-compress to do nothing (e.g. change the file contents to <code>exit 0</code>, but don't forget to create a backup copy first) otherwise you will get errors when building.</dd>
							<dt><code>bdist_lipa</code></dt>
								<dd>Create a <a href="http://listaller.tenstral.net/">Listaller</a> package.</dd>
							<dt><code>bdist_pyi</code></dt>
								<dd>An alternative to <code>bdist_standalone</code>, which uses <a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org/">PyInstaller</a> instead of bbfreeze/py2app/py2exe.</dd>
							<dt><code>bdist_standalone</code></dt>
								<dd>Creates a standalone application that does not require a Python installation. Uses bbfreeze on Linux, py2app on Mac OS X and py2exe on Windows. setup.py will try and automatically download/install these packages for you if they are not yet installed and if not using the --use-distutils switch. Note: On Mac OS X, older versions of py2app (before 0.4) are not able to access files inside python “egg” files (which are basically ZIP-compressed folders). Setuptools, which is needed by py2app, will normally be installed in “egg” form, thus preventing those older py2app versions from accessing its contents. To fix this, you need to remove any installed setuptools-&lt;version&gt;-py&lt;python-version&gt;.egg files from your Python installation's site-packages directory (normally found under <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib</code>). Then, run <code>sudo python util/ez_setup.py -Z setuptools</code> which will install setuptools unpacked, thus allowing py2app to acces all its files. This is no longer an issue with py2app 0.4 and later.</dd>
							<dt><code>buildservice</code></dt>
								<dd>Creates control files for openSUSE Build Service (also happens implicitly when invoking <code>sdist</code>).</dd>
							<dt><code>finalize_msi</code> (Windows only)</dt>

			<h3>Instrument-specific setup</h3>

			<p>Choose “Import colorimeter corrections from other display profiling software...” from DisplayCAL's “Tools” menu.</p>
	
			<p><strong>If your measurement device is a Spyder 2</strong>, you need to enable it to be able to use it with Argyll CMS and DisplayCAL. Choose “Enable Spyder 2 colorimeter...” from DisplayCAL's “Tools” menu.</p>

		</div>

		<div id="concept">
			<h2>Basic concept of display calibration and profiling</h2>

			<p>If you have previous experience, <a href="#colorimeter-corrections">skip ahead</a>. If you are new to display 
			calibration, here is a quick outline of the basic concept.</p>

			<p>First, the display behavior is measured and adjusted to meet 
			user-definable target characteristics, like brightness, gamma and white point. 
			This step is generally referred to as <em>calibration</em>. Calibration is done by 
			adjusting the monitor controls, and the output of the graphics card (via 
			<em>calibration curves</em>, also sometimes called <em>video <abbr title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></abbr> curves</em>—please don't confuse these with <em>LUT profiles</em>, the <a href="#difference_lutcurves_lutprofile" title="Difference between LUT (calibration) curves and LUT profiles">differences are explained here</a>) to get as 
			close as possible to the chosen target.<br />
			To meet the user-defined target characteristics, it is generally advisable to 
			get as far as possible by using the monitor controls, and only thereafter by 
			manipulating the output of the video card via calibration curves, which are loaded into the <em>video card gamma table</em>, to get the best
			results.</p>

			<p>Second, the calibrated displays response is measured and an <abbr title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[5]</a></sup></abbr> profile 
			describing it is created.</p>

			<p>Optionally and for convenience purposes, the calibration is stored in the profile, but both 
			still need to be used together to get correct results. This can lead to some ambiguity, 
			because loading the calibration curves from the profile is generally the 
			responsibility of a third party utility or the OS, while applications using 
			the profile to do color transforms usually don't know or care about the calibration (they don't need to). Currently, the only OS that 
			applies calibration curves out-of-the-box is Mac OS X (under <a href="#issue-win7-autoloadcalibration">Windows 7 or later you can enable it</a>, but it's off by default and doesn't offer the same high precision as the DisplayCAL profile loader)—for other OS's, DisplayCAL takes care of creating an appropriate loader.</p>

			<p>Even non-color-managed applications will benefit from a loaded 
			calibration because it is stored in the graphics card—it is “global”. But the calibration alone will not yield accurate colors—only fully color-managed applications will make use of display 
			profiles and the necessary color transforms.</p>

			<p>Regrettably there are several image viewing and editing applications that 
			only implement half-baked color management by not using the system's display profile (or any display profile at all), but an internal and often unchangeable “default”
			color space like sRGB, and sending output unaltered to the display after converting to that default colorspace. If the 
			display's actual response is close to sRGB, you might get pleasing (albeit not
			accurate) results, but on displays which behave differently, for example wide-color-gamut displays, even mundane colors can 
			get a strong tendency towards neon.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="colorimeter-corrections">
			<h2>A note about colorimeters, displays and DisplayCAL</h2>

			<p>Colorimeters need a correction in hardware or software to obtain correct measurements from different types of displays (please also see <a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/WideGamutColmters.html">“Wide Gamut Displays and Colorimeters”</a> on the Argyll CMS website for more information). The latter is supported when using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.3.0, so if you own a display and colorimeter which has not been specifically tuned for this display (i.e. does not contain a correction in hardware), you can apply a correction that has been calculated from spectrometer measurements to help better measure such a screen.<br />
			You need a spectrometer in the first place to do the necessary measurements to create such a correction, or you may query DisplayCAL's <a href="https://colorimetercorrections.displaycal.net/">Colorimeter Corrections Database</a>, and there's also a <a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/ccmxs.html">list of contributed colorimeter correction files on the Argyll CMS website</a>—<strong>please note</strong> though that a matrix created for one particular instrument/display combination may not work well for different instances of the same combination because of display manufacturing variations and generally low inter-instrument agreement of most older colorimeters (with the exception of the DTP94), newer devices like the i1 Display Pro/ColorMunki Display and possibly the Spyder 4/5 seem to be less affected by this.<br />
			Starting with DisplayCAL 0.6.8, you can also <a href="#import-correction-matrices">import generic corrections</a> from some profiling softwares by choosing the corresponding item in the “Tools” menu.</p>

			<p>If you buy a screen bundled with a colorimeter, the instrument may have been matched to the screen in some way already, so you may not need a software correction in that case.</p>

			<h3>Special note about the X-Rite i1 Display Pro, ColorMunki Display and Spyder 4/5 colorimeters</h3>

			<p>These instruments greatly reduce the amount of work needed to match them to a display because they contain the spectral sensitivities of their filters in hardware, so only a spectrometer reading of the display is needed to create the correction (in contrast to matching other colorimeters to a display, which needs two readings: One with a spectrometer and one with the colorimeter).<br />
			That means anyone with a particular screen and a spectrometer can create a special <em>Colorimeter Calibration Spectral Set</em> (<code>.ccss</code>) file of that screen for use with those colorimeters, without needing to actually have access to the colorimeter itself.</p>

			<h2>Usage</h2>

			<p>Through the main window, you can choose your settings. When running calibration measurements, another window will guide you through the interactive part of display adjustment.</p>

			<div id="settingsfile">
				<h3>Settings file</h3>
				<p>Here, you can load a preset, or a calibration (<code>.cal</code>) or ICC profile (<code>.icc</code> / <code>.icm</code>) file from a previous 
				run. This will set options to 
				those stored in the file. If the file contains only a subset of settings, the other options will automatically be reset to defaults (except the 3D LUT settings, which won't be reset if the settings file doesn't contain 3D LUT settings, and the verification settings which will never be reset automatically).</p>

				<p>If a calibration file or profile is loaded in this way, its name will
				show up here to indicate that the settings reflect those in the file.
				Also, if a calibration is present it can be used as the base when “Just Profiling”.<br />
				The chosen settings file will stay selected as long as you do not change any of the 
				calibration or profiling settings, with one exception: When a <code>.cal</code> file with the same base name as the settings file
				exists in the same directory, adjusting the quality and profiling controls will not cause unloading of the settings file. This allows you to use an existing calibration with new profiling settings for “Just Profiling”, or to update an existing calibration with different quality and/or profiling settings. If you change settings in other situations, the file will get unloaded (but current settings will be retained—unloading just happens to remind you that the settings no longer match those in the file), and current display profile's calibration curves will be restored (if present, otherwise they will reset to linear).</p>

				<p>When a calibration file is selected, the “Update calibration”
				checkbox will become available, which takes less time than a calibration from scratch.
				If a <abbr title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[5]</a></sup></abbr> profile is selected, and a calibration file with the same base name
				exists in the same directory, the profile will be updated with the new calibration. Ticking the “Update calibration” checkbox will gray out
				all options as well as the “Calibrate &amp; profile” and “Just profile” buttons, only the quality level will be changeable.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="presets">
				<h3>Predefined settings (presets)</h3>

				<p>Starting with DisplayCAL v0.2.5b, predefined settings for several use cases are selectable in the settings dropdown. I strongly recommend to NOT view these presets as the solitary “correct” settings you absolutely should use unmodified if your use case matches their description. Rather view them as starting points, from where you can work towards your own, optimized (in terms of your requirements, hardware, surroundings, and personal preference) settings.</p>

				<h4>Why has a default gamma of 2.2 been chosen for some presets?</h4>

				<p>Many displays, be it CRT, LCD, Plasma or OLED, have a default response characteristic close to a gamma of approx. 2.2-2.4 (for CRTs, this is the actual native behaviour; and other technologies typically try to mimic CRTs). A target response curve for calibration that is reasonably close to the native response of a display should help to minimize calibration artifacts like banding, because the adjustments needed to the video card's gamma tables via calibration curves will not be as strong as if a target response farther away from the display's native response had been chosen.</p>
				<p>Of course, you can and should change the calibration response curve to a value suitable for your own requirements. For example, you might have a display that offers hardware calibration or gamma controls, that has been internally calibrated/adjusted to a different response curve, or your display's response is simply not close to a gamma of 2.2 for other reasons. You can run “Report on uncalibrated display device” from the “Tools” menu to measure the approximated overall gamma among other info.</p>

				<h3>Choosing the display to calibrate and the measurement device</h3>

				<p>After connecting the instrument, click the small icon with the swirling arrow <img src="theme/refresh_lr.png" alt="" /> in between the “Display device” and “Instrument” controls to detect connected display devices and instruments.</p>

				<h4 id="settings_display_device">Choosing a display device</h4>
				
				<p>Directly connected displays will appear at the top of the list as entries in the form “Display Name/Model @ x, y, w, h” with x, y, w and h being virtual screen coordinates depending on resolution and DPI settings. Apart from those directly connected displays, a few additional options are also available:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Web @ localhost</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Starts a standalone web server on your machine, which then allows a local or remote web browser to display the color test patches, e.g. to calibrate/profile a smartphone or tablet computer.</p>

							<p>Note that if you use this method of displaying test patches, then colors will be displayed with 8 bit per component precision, and any screen-saver or power-saver will <strong>not</strong> be automatically disabled. You will also be at the mercy of any color management applied by the web browser, and may have to carefully review and configure such color management.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt>madVR</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Causes test patches to be displayed using the madVR Test Pattern Generator (madTPG) application which comes with the <a href="http://madvr.com/">madVR video renderer</a> (only available for Windows, but you can connect via local network from Linux and Mac OS X). Note that while you can adjust the test pattern configuration controls in madTPG itself, you should not normally alter the “disable videoLUT” and “disable 3D LUT” controls, as these will be set appropriately automatically when doing measurements.</p>

							<p>Note that if you want to create a 3D LUT for use with madVR, there is a “Video 3D LUT for madVR” preset available under “Settings” that will not only configure DisplayCAL to use madTPG, but also setup the correct 3D LUT format and encoding for madVR.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt>Prisma</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>The Q, Inc./Murideo Prisma is a video processor and combined pattern generator/3D LUT holder accessible over the network.</p>

							<p>Note that if you want to create a 3D LUT for use with a Prisma, there is a “Video 3D LUT for Prisma” preset available under “Settings” that will not only configure DisplayCAL to use a Prisma, but also setup the correct 3D LUT format and encoding.</p>

							<p>Also note that the Prisma has 1 MB of internal memory for custom LUT storage, which is enough for around 15 17x17x17 LUTs. You may occasionally need to enter the Prisma's administrative interface via a web browser to delete old LUTs to make space for new ones.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt>Resolve</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Allows you to use the built-in pattern generator of DaVinci Resolve video editing and grading software, which is accessible over the network or on the local machine. The way this works is that you start a calibration or profiling run in DisplayCAL, position the measurement window and click “Start measurement”. A message “Waiting for connection on IP:PORT” should appear. Note the IP and port numbers. In Resolve, switch to the “Color” tab and then choose “Monitor calibration”, “CalMAN” in the “Color” menu (Resolve version 11 and earlier) or the “Workspace” menu (Resolve 12).<br />
Enter the IP address in the window that opens (port should already be filled) and click “Connect” (if Resolve is running on the same machine as DisplayCAL, enter <code>localhost</code> or <code>127.0.0.1</code> instead). The position of the measurement window you placed earlier will be mimicked on the display you have connected via Resolve.</p>

							<p>Note that if you want to create a 3D LUT for use with Resolve, there is a “Video 3D LUT for Resolve” preset available under “Settings” that will not only configure DisplayCAL to use Resolve, but also setup the correct 3D LUT format and encoding.</p>

							<p><strong>Note</strong> that if you want to create a 3D LUT for a display that is <strong>directly connected</strong> (e.g. for Resolve's GUI viewer), you should <strong>not</strong> use the Resolve pattern generator, and select the actual display device instead which will allow for quicker measurements (Resolve's pattern generator has additional delay).</p>
						</dd>

					<dt>Untethered</dt>

						</dd>
				</dl>
				
				<h4 id="settings_measurement_modes">Choosing a measurement mode</h4>
				
				<p>Some instruments may support different measurement modes for different types of display devices. In general, there are two base measurement modes: “LCD” and “Refresh” (e.g. CRT and Plasma are refresh-type displays). Some instruments like the Spyder 4/5 and ColorHug support additional measurement modes, where a mode is coupled with a predefined colorimeter correction (in that case, the <a href="#settings_colorimeter_correction">colorimeter correction</a> dropdown will automatically be set to “None”).<br />
				Variations of these measurement modes may be available depending on the instrument: “Adaptive” measurement mode for spectrometers uses varying integration times (always used by colorimeters) to increase accuracy of dark readings. “HiRes” turns on high resolution spectral mode for spectrometers like the i1 Pro, which may increase the accuracy of measurements.</p>

				<h4 id="settings_drift_compensation">Drift compensation during measurements (only available if using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.3.0)</h4>
				
				<p>White level drift compensation tries to counter luminance changes of a warming up display device. For this purpose, a white test patch is measured periodically, which increases the overall time needed for measurements.</p>

				<p>Black level drift compensation tries to counter measurement deviations caused by black calibration drift of a warming up measurement device. For this purpose, a black test patch is measured periodically, which increases the overall time needed for measurements. Many colorimeters are temperature stabilised, in which case black level drift compensation should not be needed, but spectrometers like the i1 Pro or ColorMunki Design/Photo are not temperature compensated.</p>

				<h4 id="display-update-delay">Override display update delay (only available if using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.5.0, only visible if “Show advanced options” in the “Options” menu is enabled)</h4>
				
				<p>Normally a delay of 200 msec is allowed between changing a patch color in software, and that change appearing in the displayed color itself. For some instuments (i.e. i1d3, i1pro, ColorMunki, Klein K10-A) ArgyllCMS will automatically measure and set an appropriate update delay during instrument calibration. In rare situations this delay may not be sufficient (ie. some TV's with extensive image processing features turned on), and a larger delay can be set here.</p>

				<h4 id="display-settle-time">Override display settle time multiplier (only available if using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.7.0, only visible if “Show advanced options” in the “Options” menu is enabled)</h4>
				
				<p>Normally the display technology type determines how long is allowed between when a patch color change appears on the display, and when that change has settled down, and as actually complete within measurement tolerance. A CRT or Plasma display for instance, can have quite a long settling delay due to the decay characteristics of the phosphor used, while an LCD can also have a noticeable settling delay due to the liquid crystal response time and any response time enhancement circuit (instruments without a display technology type selection such as spectrometers assume a worst case).<br />
				The display settle time multiplier allows the rise and fall times of the model to be scaled to extend or reduce the settling time. For instance, a multiplier of 2.0 would double the settling time, while a multiplier of 0.5 would halve it.</p>

				<h4 id="settings_colorimeter_correction">Choosing a colorimeter correction for a particular display</h4>

				<p>This can improve a colorimeters accuracy for a particular type of display, please also see <a href="#colorimeter-corrections">“A note about colorimeters, displays and DisplayCAL”</a>. You can import generic matrices from some other display profiling softwares as well as check the online <a href="https://colorimetercorrections.displaycal.net/">Colorimeter Corrections Database</a> for a match of your display/instrument combination (click the small globe next to the correction dropdown)—<strong>please note</strong> though that all colorimeter corrections in the online database have been contributed by various users, and their usefulness to your particular situation is up to you to evaluate: They may or may not improve the absolute accuracy of your colorimeter with your display. A <a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/ccmxs.html">list of contributed correction matrices</a> can also be found on the Argyll CMS website.</p>

				<p>Please note this option is only available if using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.3.0 and a colorimeter.</p>

						<dd>
							<p>To see this setting, you need to have an instrument that supports spectral readings (i.e. a spectrometer) or spectral sample calibration (e.g. i1 DisplayPro, ColorMunki Display and Spyder4/5), and go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced options”.</p>

							<p>This can be used to select a different colorimetric observer, also known as color matching function (CMF), for instruments that support it. The default is the CIE 1931 standard 2° observer.</p>

							<p><strong>Note</strong> that if you select anything other than the default 1931 2 degree observer, then the Y values will not be cd/m², due to the Y curve not being the CIE 1924 photopic V(λ) luminosity function.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_white_point">White point</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Allows setting the target white point locus to the equivalent of a daylight or black body spectrum of the given temperature in degrees Kelvin, or as chromaticity co-ordinates. By default the white point target will be the native white of the display, and it's color temperature and delta E to the daylight spectrum locus will be shown during monitor adjustment, and adjustments will be recommended to put the display white point directly on the Daylight locus. If a daylight color temperature is given, then this will become the target of the adjustment, and the recommended adjustments will be those needed to make the monitor white point meet the target. Typical  values might be 5000 for matching printed output, or 6500, which gives a brighter, bluer look. A white point temperature different to that native to the display may limit the maximum brightness possible.</p>

							<p>If you want to find out the current uncalibrated whitepoint of your display, you can run “Report on uncalibrated display device” from the “Tools” menu to measure it.</p>

							<p>If you want to adjust the whitepoint to the chromaticities of your ambient lighting, or those of a viewing booth as used in prepress and photography, and your measurement device has ambient measuring capability (e.g. like the i1 Pro or i1 Display with their respective ambient measurement heads), you can use the “Measure ambient” button next to the whitepoint settings. If you want to measure ambient lighting, place the instrument upwards, beside the display. Or if you want to measure a viewing booth, put a metamerism-free gray card inside the booth and point the instrument towards it. Further instructions how to measure ambient may be available in your instrument's documentation.</p>

							<h4>Visual whitepoint editor</h4>
							<p>The visual whitepoint editor allows visually adjusting the whitepoint on display devices that lack hardware controls as well as match several displays to one another (or a reference). To use it, set the whitepoint to “Chromaticity” and click the visual whitepoint editor button (you can open as many visual whitepoint editors simultaneously as you like, so that e.g. one can be left unchanged as reference, while the other can be adjusted to match said reference). The editor window can be put into a distraction-free fullscreen mode by maximizing it (press ESC to leave fullscreen again). Adjust the whitepoint using the controls on the editor tool pane until you have achieved a visual match. Then, place your instrument on the measurement area and click “Measure”. The measured whitepoint will be set as calibration target.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_white_level">White level</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Set the target brightness of white in cd/m<sup>2</sup>. If this number cannot be reached, the brightest output possible is chosen, consistent with matching the white point target. Note that many of the instruments are not particularly accurate when assessing the absolute display brightness in cd/m<sup>2</sup>. Note that some LCD screens behave a little strangely near their absolute white point, and may therefore exhibit odd behavior at values just below white. It may be advisable in such cases to set a brightness slightly less than the maximum such a display is capable of.</p>

							<p>If you want to find out the current uncalibrated white level of your display, you can run “Report on uncalibrated display device” from the “Tools” menu to measure it.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_black_level">Black level</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>(To see this setting, go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced options”)</p>

							<p>Can be used to set the target brightness of black in cd/m<sup>2</sup> and is useful for e.g. matching two different screens with different native blacks to one another, by measuring the black levels on both (i.e. in the “Tools” menu, choose “Report on uncalibrated display”) and then entering the highest measured value. Normally you may want to use native black level though, to maximize contrast ratio. Setting too high a value may also give strange results as it interacts with trying to achieve the target “advertised” tone curve shape. Using a black output offset of 100% tries to minimize such problems.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="trc">Tone curve / gamma</dt>
						<dd>							
							<p>The target response curve is normally an exponential curve (output = input<sup>gamma</sup>), and defaults to 2.2 (which is close to a typical CRT displays real response). Four pre-defined curves can be used as well: the sRGB colorspace response curve, which is an exponent curve with a straight segment at the dark end and an overall response of approximately gamma 2.2, the L* curve, which is the response of the CIE L*a*b* perceptual colorspace, the Rec. 709 video standard response curve and the SMPTE 240M video standard response curve.<br />
							Another possible choice is “As measured”, which will skip video card gamma table (1D LUT) calibration.</p>

							<p>Note that a real display usually can't reproduce any of the ideal pre-defined curves, since it will have a non-zero black point, whereas all the ideal curves assume zero light at zero input.</p>

							<p>For gamma values, you can also specify wheter it should be interpreted relative, meaning the gamma value provided is used to set an actual response curve in light of the non-zero black of the actual display that has the same relative output at 50% input as the ideal gamma power curve, or absolute, which allows the actual power to be specified instead, meaning that after the actual displays non-zero black is accounted for, the response at 50% input will probably not match that of the ideal power curve with that gamma value (to see this setting, you have to go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced options”).</p>

							<p>To allow for the non-zero black level of a real display, by default the target curve values will be offset so that zero input gives the actual black level of the display (output offset). This ensures that the target curve better corresponds to the typical natural behavior of displays, but it may not be the most visually even progression from display minimum. This behavior can be changed using the black output offset option (see further below).</p>

							<p>Also note that many color spaces are encoded with, and labelled as having a gamma of approximately 2.2 (ie. sRGB, REC 709, SMPTE 240M, Macintosh OS X 10.6), but are actually intended to be displayed on a display with a typical CRT gamma of 2.4 viewed in a darkened environment.<br />
							This is because this 2.2 gamma is a source gamma encoding in bright viewing conditions such as a television studio, while typical display viewing conditions are quite dark by comparison, and a contrast expansion of (approx.) gamma 1.1 is desirable to make the images look as intended.<br />
							So if you are displaying images encoded to the sRGB standard, or displaying video through the calibration, just setting the gamma curve to sRGB or REC 709 (respectively) is probably not what you want! What you probably want to do, is to set the gamma curve to about gamma 2.4, so that the contrast range is expanded appropriately, or alternatively use sRGB or REC 709 or a gamma of 2.2 but also specify the actual ambient viewing conditions via a light level in Lux, so that an appropriate contrast enhancement can be made during calibration. If your instrument is capable of measuring ambient light levels, then you can do so.<br />
							<span class="footnote">(For in-depth technical information about sRGB, see “<a href="http://www.color.org/sRGB.xalter">A Standard Default Color Space for the Internet: sRGB</a>” at the <abbr title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[5]</a></sup></abbr> website for details of how it is intended to be used)</span></p>

							<p>If you're wondering what gamma value you should use, you can run “Report on uncalibrated display device” from the “Tools” menu to measure the approximated overall gamma among other info. Setting the gamma to the reported value can then help to reduce calibration artifacts like banding, because the adjustments needed for the video card's gamma table should not be as strong as if a gamma further away from the display's native response was chosen.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="ambient">Ambient light level</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>(To see this setting, go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced options”)</p>

							<p>As explained for the tone curve settings, often colors are encoded in a situation with viewing conditions that are quite different to the viewing conditions of a typical display, with the expectation that this difference in viewing conditions will be allowed for in the way the display is calibrated. The ambient light level option is a way of doing this. By default calibration will not make any allowances for viewing conditions, but will calibrate to the specified response curve, but if the ambient light level is entered or measured, an appropriate viewing conditions adjustment will be performed. For a gamma value or sRGB, the original viewing conditions will be assumed to be that of the sRGB standard viewing conditions, while for REC 709 and SMPTE 240M they will be assumed to be television studio viewing conditions.<br />
							By specifying or measuring the ambient lighting for your display, a viewing conditions adjustment based on the CIECAM02 color appearance model will be made for the brightness of your display and the contrast it makes with your ambient light levels.</p>

							<p>Please note your measurement device needs ambient measuring capability (e.g. like the i1 Pro or i1 Display with their respective ambient measurement heads) to measure the ambient light level.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_black_output_offset">Black output offset</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>(To see this setting, go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced options”)</p>

							<p>Real displays do not have a zero black response, while all the target response curves do, so this has to be allowed for in some way.</p>

							<p>The default way of handling this (equivalent to 100% black output offset) is to allow for this at the output of the ideal response curve, by offsetting and scaling the output values. This defined a curve that will match the responses that many other systems provide and may be a better match to the natural response of the display, but will give a less visually even response from black.</p>

							<p>The other alternative is to offset and scale the input values into the ideal response curve so that zero input gives the actual non-zero display response. This ensures the most visually even progression from display minimum, but might be hard to achieve since it is different to the natural response of a display.</p>

							<p>A subtlety is to provide a split between how much of the offset is accounted for as input to the ideal response curve, and how much is accounted for at the output, where the degree is 0.0 accounts for it all as input offset, and 100% accounts for all of it as output offset.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_black_point_correction">Black point correction</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>(To see this setting, go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced options”)</p>

							<p>Normally dispcal will attempt to make all colors down the neutral axis (R=G=B) have the same hue as the chosen white point. Near the black point, red, green or blue can only be added, not subtracted from zero, so the process of making the near black colors have the desired hue, will lighten them to some extent. For a device with a good contrast ratio or a black point that has nearly the same hue as the white, this is not a problem. If the device contrast ratio is not so good, and the black hue is noticeably different to that of the chosen white point (which is often the case for LCD type displays), this could have a noticeably detrimental effect on an already limited contrast ratio. Here the amount of black point hue correction can be controlled.<br />
							By default a factor of 100% will be used, which is usually good for “Refresh”-type displays like CRT or Plasma and also by default a factor of 0% is used for LCD type displays, but you can override these with a custom value between 0% (no correction) to 100% (full correction), or enable automatically setting it based on the measured black level of the display.</p>

							<p>If less than full correction is chosen, then the resulting calibration curves will have the target white point down most of the curve, but will then cross over to the native or compromise black point.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_calibration_black_point_correction_rate">Black point correction rate (only available if using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.0.4)</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>(To see this setting, go into the “Options” menu, and enable “Show advanced options”)</p>

							<p>If the black point is not being set completely to the same hue as the white point (ie. because the factor is less than 100%), then the resulting calibration curves will have the target white point down most of the curve, but will then blend over to the native or compromise black point that is blacker, but not of the right hue. The rate of this blend can be controlled. The default value is 4.0, which results in a target that switches from the white point target to the black, moderately close to the black point. While this typically gives a good visual result with the target neutral hue being maintained to the point where the crossover to the black hue is not visible, it may be asking too much of some displays (typically LCD type displays), and there may be some visual effects due to inconsistent color with viewing angle. For this situation a smaller value may give a better visual result (e.g. try values of 3.0 or 2.0. A value of 1.0 will set a pure linear blend from white point to black point). If there is too much coloration near black, try a larger value, e.g. 6.0 or 8.0.</p>

							L*a*b* or XYZ can be used as <abbr title="Profile Connection Space">PCS<sup><a href="#definition_PCS">[11]</a></sup></abbr>, with XYZ being recommended especially for wide-gamut displays bacause their primaries might exceed the <abbr title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[5]</a></sup></abbr> L*a*b* encoding range (Note: Under Windows, XYZ <abbr title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></abbr> types are only available in DisplayCAL if using Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.1.0 because of a requirement for matrix tags in the profile, which are not created by prior Argyll CMS versions).<br />
							As it is hard to verify if the <abbr title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></abbr> of an combined XYZ <abbr title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></abbr> + matrix profile is actually used, you may choose to create a profile with a swapped matrix, ie. blue-red-green instead of red-green-blue, so it will be obvious if an application uses the (deliberately wrong) matrix instead of the (correct) LUT because the colors will look very wrong (e.g. everything that should be red will be blue, green will be red, blue will be green, yellow will be purple etc).</p>

							<p id="difference_lutcurves_lutprofile">Note: <abbr title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></abbr>-based profiles (which contain three-dimensional LUTs) might be confused with video card <abbr title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></abbr> (calibration) curves (one-dimensional LUTs), but they're two different things.

						</dd>

					<dt id="settings_profiling_gamutmapping">Advanced gamut mapping options (enable “Show advanced options” in the “Options” menu)</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>You can choose any of the following options after selecting a LUT profile type and clicking “Advanced...”. <em>Note:</em> The options “Low quality <abbr title="Profile Connection Space">PCS<sup><a href="#definition_PCS">[11]</a></sup></abbr>-to-device tables” and “Enhance effective resolution of colorimetric <abbr title="Profile Connection Space">PCS<sup><a href="#definition_PCS">[11]</a></sup></abbr>-to-device table” are mutually exclusive.</p>
							
							<h4>Low quality <abbr title="Profile Connection Space">PCS<sup><a href="#definition_PCS">[11]</a></sup></abbr>-to-device tables</h4>
							<p>Choose this option if the profile is only going to be used with inverse device-to-<abbr title="Profile Connection Space">PCS<sup><a href="#definition_PCS">[11]</a></sup></abbr> gamut mapping to create a DeviceLink or 3D LUT (DisplayCAL always uses inverse device-to-<abbr title="Profile Connection Space">PCS<sup><a href="#definition_PCS">[11]</a></sup></abbr> gamut mapping when creating a DeviceLink/3D LUT). This will reduce the processing time needed to create the <abbr title="Profile Connection Space">PCS<sup><a href="#definition_PCS">[11]</a></sup></abbr>-to-device tables. <strong>Don't</strong> choose this option if you want to install or otherwise use the profile.</p>

							<h4 id="b2a-enhance-effective-resolution">Enhance effective resolution of colorimetric <abbr title="Profile Connection Space">PCS<sup><a href="#definition_PCS">[11]</a></sup></abbr>-to-device table</h4>

							<p>To use this option, you have to select a XYZ or L*a*b* LUT profile type (XYZ will be more effective). This option increases the effective resolution of the <abbr title="Profile Connection Space">PCS<sup><a href="#definition_PCS">[11]</a></sup></abbr> to device colorimetric color lookup table by using a matrix to limit the XYZ space and fill the whole grid with the values obtained by inverting the device-to-<abbr title="Profile Connection Space">PCS<sup><a href="#definition_PCS">[11]</a></sup></abbr> table, as well as optionally applies smoothing. If no <a href="#settings_profiling_gamutmapping_ciecam02">CIECAM02 gamut mapping</a> has been enabled for the perceptual intent, a simple but effective perceptual table (which is almost identical to the colorimetric table, but maps the black point to zero) will also be generated.</p>
							<p>You can also set the interpolated lookup table size. The default “Auto” will use a base 33x33x33 resulution that is increased if needed and provide a good balance between smoothness and accuracy. Lowering the resolution can increase smoothness (at the potential expense of some accuracy), while increasing resolution may make the resulting profile potentially more accurate (at the expense of some smoothness). Note that computation will need a lot of memory (&gt;= 4 GB of RAM recommended to prevent swapping to harddisk) especially at higher resolutions.</p>
							<p>See below example images for the result you can expect, where the original image has been converted from sRGB to the display profile. Note though that the particular synthetic image chosen, a “granger rainbow”, exaggerates banding, real-world material is much less likely to show this. Also note that the sRGB blue in the image is actually out of gamut for the specific display used, and the edges visible in the blue gradient for the rendering are a result of the color being out of gamut, and the gamut mapping thus hitting the less smooth gamut boundaries.</p>

							<h4>Default rendering intent for profile</h4>
							<p>Sets the default rendering intent. In theory applications could use this, in practice they don't, so changing this setting probably won't have any effect whatsoever.</p>
							
							<h4 id="settings_profiling_gamutmapping_ciecam02">CIECAM02 gamut mapping</h4>

							<p>Note: When enabling one of the CIECAM02 gamut mapping options, and the source profile is a matrix profile, then enabling effective resolution enhancement will also influence the CIECAM02 gamut mapping, making it smoother, more accurate and also generated faster as a side-effect.</p>

							<p>Normally, profiles created by DisplayCAL only incorporate the colorimetric rendering intent, which means colors outside the display's gamut will be clipped to the next in-gamut color. LUT-type profiles can also have gamut mapping by implementing perceptual and/or saturation rendering intents (gamut compression/expansion). You can choose if and which of those you want by specifying a source profile and marking the appropriate checkboxes. Note that a input, output, display or device colororspace profile should be specified as source, not a non-device colorspace, device link, abstract or named color profile. You can also choose viewing conditions which describe the intended use of both the source and the display profile that is to be generated. An appropriate source viewing condition is chosen automatically based on the source profile type.</p>

							<p>An explanation of the available rendering intents can be found in the 3D LUT section “<a href="#rendering-intents">Rendering intent</a>”.</p>

							<p>For more information on why a source gamut is needed, see “<a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/iccgamutmapping.html">About ICC profiles and Gamut Mapping</a>” in the Argyll CMS documentation.</p>

							<p>One strategy for getting the best perceptual results with display profiles is as follows: Select a CMYK profile as source for gamut mapping. Then, when converting from another RGB profile to the display profile, use relative colorimetric intent, and if converting from a CMYK profile, use the perceptual intent.<br />
							Another approach which especially helps limited-gamut displays is to choose one of the larger (gamut-wise) source profiles you usually work with for gamut mapping, and then always use perceptual intent when converting to the display profile.</p>

							<p>Please note that not all applications support setting a rendering intent for display profiles and might default to colorimetric (e.g. Photoshop normally uses relative colorimetric with black point compensation, but can use different intents via custom soft proofing settings).</p>
						</dd>

					<dt id="testchart_file">Testchart file</dt>
						<dd>You can choose the test patches used when profiling the display here. The default “Auto” optimized setting takes the actual display characteristics into account. You can further increase potential profile accuracy by increasing the number of patches using the slider.</dd>

					<dt id="testchart_editor">Testchart editor</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>The provided default testcharts should work well in most situations, but allowing you to create custom charts ensures maximum flexibility when characterizing a display and can improve profiling accuracy and efficiency. See also <a href="#optimizecharts">optimizing testcharts</a>.</p>

							<h4>Testchart generation options</h4>

							<p>You can enter the amount of patches to be generated for each patch type (white, black, gray, single channel, iterative and multidimensional cube steps). The iterative algorythm can be tuned if more than zero patches are to be generated. What follows is a quick description of the several available iterative algorythms, with “device space” meaning in this case RGB coordinates, and “perceptual space” meaning the (assumed) XYZ numbers of those RGB coordinates. The assumed XYZ numbers can be influenced by providing a previous profile, thus allowing optimized test point placement.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Optimized Farthest Point Sampling (OFPS) will optimize the point locations to minimize the distance from any point in device space to the nearest sample point</li>
								<li>Incremental Far Point Distribution incrementally searches for test points that are as far away as possible from any existing points</li>
								<li>Device space random chooses test points with an even random distribution in device space</li>
								<li>Perceptual space random chooses test points with an even random distribution in perceptual space</li>
								<li>Device space filling quasi-random chooses test points with a quasi-random, space filling distribution in device space</li>
								<li>Perceptual space filling quasi-random chooses test points with a quasi-random, space filling distribution in perceptual space</li>
								<li>Device space body centered cubic grid chooses test points with body centered cubic distribution in device space</li>
								<li>Perceptual space body centered cubic grid chooses test points with body centered cubic distribution in perceptual space</li>
							</ul>

							<p>You can set the degree of adaptation to the known device characteristics used by the default full spread OFPS algorithm. A preconditioning profile should be provided if adaptation is set above a low level. By default the adaptation is 10% (low), and should be set to 100% (maximum) if a profile is provided. But, if for instance, the preconditioning profile doesn't represent the device behavior very well, a lower adaption than 100% might be appropriate.</p>

							<p>For the body centered grid distributions, the angle parameter sets the overall angle that the grid distribution has.</p>

							<p>The “Gamma” parameter sets a power-like (to avoid the excessive compression that a real power function would apply) value applied to all of the device values after they are generated. A value greater than 1.0 will cause a tighter spacing of test values near device value 0.0, while a value less than 1.0 will cause a tighter spacing near device value 1.0. Note that the device model used to create the expected patch values will not take into account the applied power, nor will the more complex full spread algorithms correctly take into account the power.</p>

							<p>The neutral axis emphasis parameter allows changing the degree to which the patch distribution should emphasise the neutral axis. Since the neutral axis is regarded as the most visually critical area of the color space, it can help maximize the quality of the resulting profile to place more measurement patches in this region. This emphasis is only effective for perceptual patch distributions, and for the default OFPS distribution if the adaptation parameter is set to a high value. It is also most effective when a preconditioning profile is provided, since this is the only way that neutral can be determined. The default value of 50% provides an effect about twice the emphasis of the CIE94 Delta E formula.</p>

							<p>The dark region emphasis parameter allows changing the degree to which the patch distribution should emphasis dark region of the device response. Display devices used for video or film reproduction are typically viewed in dark viewing environments with no strong white reference, and typically employ a range of brightness levels in different scenes. This often means that the devices dark region response is of particular importance, so increasing the relative number of sample points in the dark region may improve the balance of accuracy of the resulting profile for video or film reproduction. This emphasis is only effective for perceptual patch distributions where a preconditioning profile is provided. The default value of 0% provides no emphasis of the dark regions. A value somewhere around 15% - 30% is a good place to start for video profile use. A scaled down version of this parameter will be passed on to the profiler. Note that increasing the proportion of dark patches will typically lengthen the time that an instrument takes to read the whole chart. Emphasizing the dark region characterization will reduce the accuracy of measuring and modelling the lighter regions, given a fixed number of test points and profile quality/grid resolution. The parameter will also be used in an analogous way to the “Gamma” value in changing the distribution of single channel, grayscale and multidimensional steps.</p>

							<p>The “Limit samples to sphere” option is used to define an L*a*b* sphere to filter the test points through. Only test points within the sphere (defined by it's center and radius) will be in the generated testchart. This can be good for targeting supplemental test points at a troublesome area of a device. The accuracy of the L*a*b* target will be best when a reasonably accurate preconditioning profile for the device is chosen. Note that the actual number of points generated can be hard to predict, and will depend on the type of generation used. If the OFPS, device and perceptual space random and device space filling quasi-random methods are used, then the target number of points will be achieved. All other means of generating points will generate a smaller number of test points than expected. For this reason, the device space filling quasi-random method is probably the easiest to use.</p>

							<h4>Generating diagnostic 3D views of testcharts</h4>
							
							<p>You can generate 3D views in several formats. The default HTML format should be viewable in a modern WebGL-enabled browser. You can choose the colorspace(s) you want to view the results in and also control whether to use RGB black offset (which will lighten up dark colors so they are better visible) and whether you want white to be neutral. All of these options are purely visual and will not influence the actual test patches.</p>

							<h4>Other functions</h4>
							
							<p>If generating any number of iterative patches as well as single channel, gray or multidimensional patches, you can add the single channel, gray and multidimensional patches in a separate step by holding the shift key while clicking on “Create testchart”. This prevents those patches affecting the iterative patch distribution, with the drawback of making the patch distribution less even. This is an experimental feature.</p>
							
							<p>You are also able to:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Export patches as CSV, TIFF, PNG or DPX files, and set how often each patch should be repeated when exporting as images after you click the “Export” button (black patches will be repeated according to the “Max” value, and white patches according to the “Min” value, and patches in between according to their lightness in L* scaled to a value between “Min” and “Max”).</li>
								<li>Add saturation sweeps which are often used in a video or film context to check color saturation. A preconditioning profile needs to be used to enable this.</li>
								<li>Add reference patches from measurement files in CGATS format, from named color ICC profiles, or by analyzing TIFF, JPEG or PNG images. A preconditioning profile needs to be used to enable this.</li>
								<li>Sort patches by various color criteria (warning: this will interfere with the Argyll CMS 1.6.0 or newer patch order
	optimisation which minimizes measurement times, so manual sorting should only be used for visual inspection of testcharts, or if required to optimize the patch order for untethered measurements in automatic mode where it is useful to maximize the lightness difference from patch to patch so the automatism has an easier time detecting changes).</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Patch editor</h4>

							<p>Controls for the spreadsheet-like patch editor are as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>To select patches, click and drag the mouse over table cells, or hold SHIFT (select range) or CTRL/CMD (add/remove single cells/rows to/from selection)</li>
								<li>To add a patch below an existing one, double-click a row label</li>
								<li>To delete patches, select them, then hold CTRL (Linux, Windows) or CMD (Mac OS X) and hit DEL or BACKSPACE (will always delete whole rows even if only single cells are selected)</li>
								<li>CTRL-C/CTRL-V/CTRL-A = copy/paste/select all</li>
							</ul>
							<p>If you want to insert a certain amount of patches generated in a spreadsheet application (as RGB coordinates in the range 0.0-100.0 per channel), the easiest way to do this is to save them as CSV file and drag &amp; drop it on the testchart editor window to import it.</p>
						</dd>

					<dt>Profile name</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>As long as you do not enter your own text here, the profile name is auto generated from the chosen calibration and profiling options. The current auto naming mechanism creates quite verbose names which are not necessarily nice to read, but they can help in identifying the profile.<br />
							Also note that the profile name is not only used for the resulting profile, but for all intermediate files as well (filename extensions are added automatically) <em>and</em> all files are stored in a folder of that name. You can choose where this folder is created by clicking the disk icon next to the field (it defaults to your system's default location for user data).</p>

							<p>Here's an example under Linux, on other platforms some file extensions and the location of the home directory will differ. See <a href="#userdata">User data and configuration file locations</a>. You can mouse over the filenames to get a tooltip with a short description what the file is for:</p>

							<p>Chosen profile save path: <samp title="User home directory">~/.local/share/DisplayCAL/storage</samp></p>

							<p>Profile name: <samp>mydisplay</samp></p>

							<p>The following folder will be created: <samp>~/.local/share/DisplayCAL/storage/mydisplay</samp></p>

							<p>During calibration &amp; profiling the following files will be created:</p>

							<p><samp><span title="Log of the generation of the 3D representation of the profile colorspace vs. Adobe RGB (useful for troubleshooting)">~/.local/share/DisplayCAL/storage/mydisplay/mydisplay vs ClayRGB1998.log</span><br />

				<h3>Calibrating / profiling</h3>

				<p>If you are unclear about the difference between calibration and profiling (also called characterization), see “<a href="http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/calvschar.html">Calibration vs. Characterization</a>” in the Argyll CMS documentation.</p>

				<p>Please let the screen stabilize for at least half an hour after powering it up before doing any measurements or assessing its color properties. The screen can be used normally with other applications during that time.</p>

				<p>After you have set your options, click on the button at the bottom
				to start the actual calibration/profiling process. The main window will hide during measurements, and should pop up again after they are completed (or after an 
				error). You can always cancel out of running measurements using the “Cancel” button in the progress dialog, or by pressing ESC or Q. Viewing the informational log window (from the “Tools” menu) after measurements will give you access to the raw output of the Argyll CMS commandline tools and other verbose information.</p>

				<h4 id="adjusting">Adjusting a display before calibration</h4>

				<p>If you clicked “Calibrate” or “Calibrate &amp; profile” and have not turned off “Interactive display adjustment”, you will be presented with the interactive display adjustment window which contains several options to help you bring a display's characteristics closer to the chosen target values. Depending on wheter you have a “Refresh”- or LCD-type display, I will try to give some recommendations here which options to adjust, and which to skip.</p>

				<h5>Adjusting a LCD display</h5>

				<p>For LCD displays, you will in most cases only want to adjust white point (if the screen has RGB gain or other whitepoint controls) and white level (with the white level also affecting the black level unless you have a local dimming LED model), as many LCDs lack the necessary “offset” controls to adjust the black point (and even if they happen to have them, they often change the overall color temperature, not only the black point). Also note that for most LCD screens, you should leave the “contrast” control at (factory) default.</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>White point</dt>
						<dd>
							If your screen has RGB gain, colortemperature or other whitepoint controls, the first step should be adjusting the whitepoint. Note that you may also benefit from this adjustment if you have set the target whitepoint to “native”, as it will allow you to bring it closer to the daylight or blackbody locus, which can help the human visual system to better adapt to the whitepoint. Look at the bars shown during the measurements to adjust RGB gains and minimize the delta E to the target whitepoint.
						</dd>
					<dt>White level</dt>
						<dd>
							Continue with the white level adjustment. If you have set a target white level, you may reduce or increase the brightness of your screen (ideally using only the backlight) until the desired value is reached (i.e. the bar ends at the marked center position). If you haven't set a target, simply adjust the screen to a visually pleasing brightness that doesn't cause eye strain.
						</dd>
				</dl>

				<h5>Adjusting a “Refresh”-type display like CRT or Plasma</h5>

				<dl>
					<dt>Black level</dt>
						<dd>
							On “Refresh”-type displays, this adjustment is usually done using the “brightness” control. You may reduce or increase the brightness of your screen until the desired black level is reached (i.e. the bar ends at the marked center position).
						</dd>
					<dt>White point</dt>
						<dd>
							The next step should be adjusting the whitepoint, using the display's RGB gain controls or other means of adjusting the whitepoint. Note that you may also benefit from this adjustment if you have set the target whitepoint to “native”, as it will allow you to bring it closer to the daylight or blackbody locus, which can help the human visual system to better adapt to the whitepoint. Look at the bars shown during the measurements to adjust RGB gains and minimize the delta E to the target whitepoint.
						</dd>
					<dt>White level</dt>
						<dd>
							Continue with the white level adjustment. On “Refresh”-type displays this is usually done using the “contrast” control. If you have set a target white level, you may reduce or increase contrast until the desired value is reached (i.e. the bar ends at the marked center position). If you haven't set a target, simply adjust the screen to a visually pleasing level that doesn't cause eye strain.
						</dd>
					<dt>Black point</dt>
						<dd>
							If your display has RGB offset controls, you can adjust the black point as well, in much the same way that you adjusted the whitepoint.
						</dd>
				</dl>

				<h5>Finishing adjustments and starting calibration/characterization</h5>

				<p>After the adjustments, you can run a check on all the settings by choosing the last option from the left-hand menu to verify the achieved values. If adjusting one setting adversely affected another, you can then simply repeat the respective option as necessary until the target parameters are met.</p>

				<p>Finally, select “Continue on to calibration/profiling” to start the non-interactive part. You may want to get a coffee or two as the process can take a fair amount of time, especially if you selected a high quality level. If you only wanted help to adjust the display and don't want/need calibration curves to be created, you can also choose to exit by closing the interactive display adjustment window and then select “Profile only” from the main window.<br />
				If you originally selected “Calibrate &amp; profile” and fulfil the requirements for <a href="#requirements-unattended">unattended calibration &amp; profiling</a>, the characterization measurements for the profiling process should start automatically after calibration is finished. Otherwise, you may be forced to take the instrument off the screen to do a sensor self-calibration before starting the profiling measurements.</p>
				
				<h5 id="optimizecharts">Optimizing testcharts for improved profiling accuracy and efficiency</h5>
				
				<p>The easiest way to use an optimized testchart for profiling is to set the testchart to “Auto” and adjusting the patch amount slider to the desired number of test patches. Optimization will happen automatically as part of the profiling measurements (this will increase measurement and processing times by a certain degree).<br />
				Alternatively, if you want to do generate an optimized chart manually prior to a new profiling run, you could go about this in the following way:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Have a previous display profile and select it under “Settings”.</li>
					<li>Select one of the pre-baked testcharts to use as base and bring up the testchart editor.</li>
					<li>Next to “Preconditioning profile” click on “current profile”. It should automatically select the previous profile you've
					chosen. Then place a check in the checkbox. Make sure adaptation is set to a high level (e.g. 100%)</li>
					<li>If desired, adjust the number of patches and make sure the iterative patches amount is not zero.</li>
					<li>Create the chart and save it. Click “yes” when asked to select the newly generated chart.</li>
					<li>Start the profiling measurements (e.g. click “calibrate &amp; profile” or “profile only”).</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Profile installation</h4>

				<p>When installing a profile after creating or updating it, a startup item to load its calibration curves 
				automatically on login will be created (on Windows and Linux, Mac OS X does not need a loader). You may also prevent this loader from doing anything by removing the check in the “Load calibration curves on Login” checkbox in the profile installation dialog, and in case you are using Windows 7 or later, you may let the operating system handle calibration loading instead (note that the Windows internal calibration loader does not offer the same high precision as the DisplayCAL profile loader, due to wrong scaling and 8-bit quantization).</p>

				<h4>Profile loader (Windows)</h4>

				<p>Under Windows, the profile loader will stay in the taskbar tray and keep the calibration loaded (unless started with the <code>--oneshot</code> argument, which will make the loader exit after loading calibration). In addition, the profile loader is <a href="http://madvr.com/">madVR</a>-aware and will disable calibration loading if it detects e.g. madTPG or madVR being used by a video player. A right-click menu also allows you to set the desired calibration state and a few other options:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Reload calibration from current display device profile(s)</strong>. Selecting this reloads the calibration instantly, and also sets the desired calibration state (see “Preserve calibration state” below).</li>
					<li><strong>Reset video card gamma table</strong>. Selecting this resets the video card gamma tables instantly, and also sets the desired calibration state (see “Preserve calibration state” below).</li>
					<li><strong>Preserve calibration state</strong>. This periodically checks if the video card gamma tables match the desired calibration state. It may take up to three seconds until the selected calibration state is automatically re-applied.</li>
					<li><strong>Fix profile associations automatically</strong> when only one display is active in a multi-display setup. This is a work-around for applications (and Windows itself) querying the display profile in a way that does not take into account the active display, which can lead to a wrong profile being used. A pre-requisite for this working correctly is that the profile loader has to be running <strong>before</strong> you switch from a multi-display to a single-display configuration in Windows, and the profile associations have to be correct at this point. Note that quitting the profile loader will restore profile associations to what they were (honoring any changes to profile associations during its runtime).</li>
					<li><strong>Exceptions</strong>. You can override the global profile loader state on a per application basis.</li>

				<h3 id="create-3dlut">Creating 3D LUTs</h3>

				<p>You can create display correction RGB-in/RGB-out 3D LUTs (for use in video playback or editing applications/devices that don't have ICC support) as part of the profiling process.</p>

				<h4>3D LUT settings</h4>
				
				<dl>
					<dt>Create 3D LUT after profiling</dt>
					<dd>Normally after profiling, you'll be given the option to install the profile to make it available for ICC color managed applications. If this box is checked, you'll have the option to generate a 3D LUT (with the chosen settings) instead, and the 3D LUT settings will also be stored inside the profile, so that they can be easily restored by selecting the profile under “Settings” if needed. If this box is unchecked, you can create a 3D LUT from an existing profile.</dd>

					<dt>Source colorspace/source profile</dt>
					<dd>This sets the source colorspace for the 3D LUT, which is normally a video standard space like defined by Rec. 709 or Rec. 2020.</dd>

					<dt>Tone curve</dt>
					<dd>This allows to set a predefined or custom tone response curve for the 3D LUT. Predefined settings are Rec. 1886 (input offset), Gamma 2.2 (output offset, pure power), SMPTE 2084 hard clip and SMPTE 2084 roll-off (BT.2390).
					<h5>Tone curve parameters</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>“Absolute” vs. “Relative” gamma</strong> (not available for SMPTE 2084) To accomodate a non-zero black level of a real display, the tone response curve needs to be offset and scaled accordingly.<br />
						“Absolute” gamma results in an actual output at 50% input which doesn't match that of an idealized power curve (unless the black level is zero).<br />
						“Relative” gamma results in an actual output at 50% input which matches that of an idealized power curve.</li>
						<li><strong>Black output offset</strong> To accomodate a non-zero black level of a real display, the tone response curve needs to be offset and scaled accordingly. A black output offset of 0% (= all input offset) scales and offsets the input values (this matches BT.1886), while an offset of 100% scales and offsets the output values (this matches the overall curve shape of a pure power curve). A split between input and output offset is also possible.</li>
						<li><strong>Display peak luminance</strong> (only available for SMPTE 2084) This allows you to adjust the clipping point or roll-off to your display's capabilities.</li>
						<li><strong>Maximum content light level</strong> (only available for SMPTE 2084 roll-off when advanced options are enabled in the “Options” menu) HDR video content may not encode the full range of HDR luminance levels, and so clipping after a certain point may be desirable to make slightly better use of a display's peak luminance capabilities. Note that you should be careful in choosing a maximum content light level, because you need to know exactly up to which point video content encodes luminance values, and HDR metadata is not guaranteed to be a reliable source to determine this clipping point. Setting a too low value may introduce visual artifacts, therefore you should normally leave the maximum content light level at its default value of 10000 cd/m² (this matches BT.2390).</li>
						<li><strong>Content colorspace</strong> (only available for SMPTE 2084 roll-off when advanced options are enabled in the “Options” menu) HDR video content may not encode the full source gamut, and so compressing the actual encoded gamut (instead of the full source gamut) into the display gamut may be desirable. Note that there is usually no need to change this from the default (DCI P3), and that this setting will mostly affect perceptual gamut mapping, not colorimetric.</li>
					</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt>Apply calibration (vcgt) (only visible if “Show advanced options” in the “Options” menu is enabled)</dt>
					<dd>Apply the profile's 1D LUT calibration (if any) to the 3D LUT. Nornmally, this should always be enabled if the profile contains a non-linear 1D LUT calibration, otherwise you have to make sure the 1D calibration is loaded whenever the 3D LUT is used.</dd>

					<dt>Gamut mapping mode (only visible if “Show advanced options” in the “Options” menu is enabled)</dt>
					<dd>The default gamut mapping mode is “Inverse device to PCS” and gives the most accurate results. In case a profile with high enough PCS-to-device table resolution is used, the option “PCS-to-device” is selectable as well, which allows for quicker generation of a 3D LUT, but is somewhat less accurate.</dd>

					<dt id="rendering-intents">Rendering intent</dt>
					<dd>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>“Absolute colorimetric”</strong> is intended to reproduce colors exactly. Out of gamut colors will be clipped to the closest possible match. The destination whitepoint will be altered to match the source whitepoint if possible, which may get clipped if it is out of gamut.</li>
							<li><strong>“Absolute appearance”</strong> maps colors from source to destination, trying to match the appearance of colors as closely as possible, but may not exactly map the whitepoint. Out of gamut colors will be clipped to the closest possible match.</li>
							<li><strong>“Absolute colorimetric with white point scaling”</strong> behaves almost exactly like “Absolute colorimetric”, but will scale the source colorspace down to make sure the source whitepoint isn't clipped.</li>
							<li><strong>“Luminance matched appearance”</strong> linearly compresses or expands the luminance axis from white to black to match the source to the destination space, while not otherwise altering the gamut, clipping any out of gamut colors to the closest match. The destination whitepoint is <strong>not</strong> altered to match the source whitepoint.</li>
							<li><strong>“Perceptual”</strong> uses three-dimensional compression to make the source gamut fit within the destination gamut. As much as possible, clipping is avoided, hues and the overall appearance is maintained. The destination whitepoint is <strong>not</strong> altered to match the source whitepoint.

							<li><strong>“Perceptual appearance”</strong> uses three-dimensional compression to make the source gamut fit within the destination gamut. As much as possible, clipping is avoided, hues and the overall appearance is maintained. The destination whitepoint is altered to match the source whitepoint. This intent is useful if the destination gamut is smaller than the source gamut.</li>
							<li><strong>“Luminance preserving perceptual”</strong> (Argyll CMS 1.8.3+) uses compression to make the source gamut fit within the destination gamut, but very heavily weights the preservation of the luminance value of the source, which will compromise the preservation of saturation. No contrast enhancement is used if the dynamic range is reduced. This intent may be of use where preserving the tonal distinctions in images is more important than maintaining overall colorfulness or contrast.</li>
							<li><strong>“Preserve saturation”</strong> uses three-dimensional compression and expansion to try and make the source gamut match the destination gamut, and also favours higher saturation over hue or lightness preservation. The destination whitepoint is <strong>not</strong> altered to match the source whitepoint.</li>
							<li><strong>“Relative colorimetric”</strong> is intended to reproduce colors exactly, but relative to the destination whitepoint which will <strong>not</strong> be altered to match the source whitepoint. Out of gamut colors will be clipped to the closest possible match. This intent is useful if you have calibrated a display to a custom whitepoint that you want to keep.</li>
							<li><strong>“Saturation”</strong> uses the same basic gamut mapping as “Preserve saturation”, but increases saturation slightly in highly saturated areas of the gamut.</li>

					<dt>3D LUT file format</dt>
					<dd>Sets the output format for the 3D LUT. Currently supported are Autodesk/Kodak (<code>.3dl</code>), Iridas (<code>.cube</code>), eeColor (<code>.txt</code>), <a href="http://madvr.com/">madVR</a> (<code>.3dlut</code>), Pandora (<code>.mga</code>), Portable Network Graphic (<code>.png</code>), <a href="http://reshade.me/">ReShade</a> (<code>.png</code>, <code>.fx</code>) and Sony Imageworks (<code>.spi3d</code>). Note that an ICC device link profile (the ICC equivalent of an RGB-in/RGB-out 3D LUT) is always created as well.</dd>

					<dt>Input/output encoding</dt>
					<dd>Some 3D LUT formats allow you to set the input/output encoding. Note that in most cases, sensible defaults will be chosen depending on selected 3D LUT format, but may be application- or workflow-specific.</dd>

					<dt>Input/output bit depth</dt>
					<dd>Some 3D LUT formats allow you to set the input/output bit depth. Note that in most cases, sensible defaults will be chosen depending on selected 3D LUT format, but may be application- or workflow-specific.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h4>Installing 3D LUTs</h4>

				<p>Depending on the 3D LUT file format, installing or saving the 3D LUT to a specific location may be required before it can be used. You will be asked to install or save the 3D LUT directly after it was created. If you need to install or save the 3D LUT again at a later point, switch to the “3D LUT” tab and click the small “Install 3D LUT” button next to the “Settings” dropdown (the same button that installs display profiles when on the “Display &amp; instrument” tab and a directly connected, desktop-accessible display is selected).</p>

				<h4>Installing 3D LUTs for the ReShade injector</h4>

				<p>First, you need to download the latest version of <a href="http://reshade.me/">ReShade</a> and extract the ZIP file. This should result in a folder “ReShade &lt;version&gt;”. Then, install the 3D LUT from within DisplayCAL to the “ReShade &lt;version&gt;” folder (select the folder when prompted). This will activate the 3D LUT for all applications/games that you're going to use ReShade with, which you can configure using the “ReShade Assistant” application that should come with ReShade (refer to the instructions available on the ReShade website on how to configure ReShade). The default toggle key to turn the 3D LUT on and off is the HOME key. You can change this key or disable the 3D LUT altogether by editing ColorLookUpTable.fx (with a text editor) inside the “ReShade &lt;version&gt;” folder where you installed the 3D LUT. To remove the 3D LUT from ReShade completely, delete ColorLookUpTable.png and ColorLookUpTable.fx in the ReShade folder, as well as edit ReShade.fx and remove the line <code class="language-clike">#include "ColorLookupTable.fx"</code> near the end.</p>

			<div>
				<h3 id="verify-profile">Verification / measurement report</h3>

				<p>You can do verification measurements to assess the display chain's (display profile - video card and the calibration curves in its gamma table - monitor) fit to the measured data, or to find out about the soft proofing capabilities of the display chain.</p>

				<p>To do the former, you have to select a <abbr title="CGATS.5 Data Exchange Format">CGATS<sup><a href="#definition_CGATS">[1]</a></sup></abbr> testchart file containing device values (RGB). The measured values are then compared to the values obtained by feeding the device RGB numbers through the display profile (measured vs expected values). The default verification chart contains 26 patches and can be used, for example, to check if a display needs to be re-profiled. If a RGB testchart with gray patches (R=G=B) is measured, like the default and extended verification charts, you also have the option to evaluate the graybalance through the calibration only, by placing a check in the corresponding box on the report.</p>

				<p>To perform a check on the soft proofing capabilities, you have to provide a CGATS reference file containing XYZ or L*a*b* data, or a combination of simulation profile and testchart file, which will be fed through the display profile to lookup corresponding device (RGB) values, and then be sent to the display and measured. Afterwards, the measured values are compared to the original XYZ or L*a*b* values, which can give a hint how suitable (or unsuitable) the display is for softproofing to the colorspace indicated by the reference.</p>

				<p>The profile that is to be evaluated can be chosen freely. You can select it in DisplayCAL's main window under “settings”. The report files generated after the verification measurements are plain HTML with some embedded JavaScript, and are fully self-contained. They also contain the reference and measurement data, which consists of device RGB numbers, original measured XYZ values, and D50-adapted L*a*b* values computed from the XYZ numbers, and which can be examined as plain text directly from the report at the click of a button.</p>
				
				<h5>HowTo—Common scenarios</h5>

				<p>Select the profile you want to evaluate under “Settings” (for evaluating 3D LUTs and DeviceLink profiles, this setting has significance for a Rec. 1886 or custom gamma tone response curve, because they depend on the black level).</p>
				
				<p>There are two sets of default verification charts in different sizes, one for general use and one for Rec. 709 video. The “small” and “extended” versions can be used for a quick to moderate check to see if a display should be re-profiled, or if the used profile/3D LUT is any good to begin with. The “large” and “xl” versions can be used for a more thorough check. Also, you can create your own customized verification charts with the testchart editor.</p>

				<h6>Checking the accuracy of a display profile (evaluating how well the profile characterizes the display)</h6>

				<p>In this case, you want to use a testchart with RGB device values and no simulation profile. Select a suitable file under “testchart or reference” and disable “simulation profile”. Other settings that do not apply in this case will be grayed out.</p>
					
				<h6>Checking how well a display can simulate another colorspace (evaluating softproofing capabilities, 3D LUTs, DeviceLink profiles, or native display performance)</h6>

				<p>There are two ways of doing this:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Use a reference file with XYZ or L*a*b* aim values,</li>
					<li>or use a combination of testchart with RGB or CMYK device values and an RGB or CMYK simulation profile (for an RGB testchart, it will only allow you to use an RGB simulation profile and vice versa, and equally a CMYK testchart needs to be used with a CMYK simulation profile)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Then, you have a few options that influence the simulation.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Whitepoint simulation</strong>. If you are using a reference file that contains device white (100% RGB or 0% CMYK), or if you use a combination of testchart and simulation profile, you can choose if you want whitepoint simulation of the reference or simulation profile, and if so, if you want the whitepoint simulated relative to the target profile whitepoint. To explain the latter option: Let's assume a reference has a whitepoint that is slightly blueish (compared to D50), and a target profile has a whitepoint that is more blueish (compared to D50). If you do <em>not</em> choose to simulate the reference white relative to the target profile whitepoint, and the target profile's gamut is large and accurate enough to accomodate the reference white, then that is exactly what you will get. Depending on the adaptation state of your eyes though, it may be reasonable to assume that you are to a large extent adapted to the target profile whitepoint (assuming it is valid for the device), and the simulated whitepoint will look a little yellowish compared to the target profile whitepoint. In this case, choosing to simulate the whitepoint relative to that of the target profile may give you a better visual match e.g. in a softproofing scenario where you compare to a hardcopy proof under a certain illuminant, that is close to but not quite D50, and the display whitepoint has been matched to that illuminant. It will “add” the simulated whitepoint “on top” of the target profile whitepoint, so in our example the simulated whitepoint will be even more blueish than that of the target profile alone.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Using the simulation profile as target profile</strong> will override the profile set under “Settings”. Whitepoint simulation does not apply here because color management will not be used and the display device is expected to be in the state described by the simulation profile. This may be accomplished in several ways, for example the display may be calibrated internally or externally, by a 3D LUT or device link profile. If this setting is enabled, a few other options will be available:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Enable 3D LUT</strong> (if using the <a href="http://madvr.com/">madVR</a> display device/madTPG under Windows, or a Prisma video processor). This allows you to check how well the 3D LUT transforms the simulation colorspace to the display colorspace. Note this setting can not be used together with a DeviceLink profile.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>DeviceLink profile</strong>. This allows you to check how well the DeviceLink transforms the simulation colorspace to the display colorspace. Note this setting can not be used together with the “Enable 3D LUT” setting.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Tone response curve</strong>. If you are evaluating a 3D LUT or DeviceLink profile, choose the same settings here as during 3D LUT/DeviceLink creation (and also make sure the same target profile is set, because it is used to map the blackpoint).<br />
						To check a display that does not have an associated profile (e.g. “Untethered”), set the verification tone curve to “Unmodified”. In case you want to verify against a different tone response curve instead, you need to create a synthetic profile for this purpose (“Tools” menu).
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>How were the nominal and recommended aim values chosen?</h4>

				<p>The nominal tolerances, with the whitepoint, average, maximum and gray balance Delta E CIE 1976 aim values stemming from <a href="https://www.fogra.org/mediawedge/">UGRA/Fogra Media Wedge</a> and <a href="https://www.ugra.ch/udact-ugra-certifydisplay/">UDACT</a>, are pretty generous, so I've included somewhat stricter “recommended” numbers which I've chosen more or less arbitrarily to provide a bit “extra safety margin”.</p>

				<p>For reports generated from reference files that contain CMYK numbers in addition to L*a*b* or XYZ values, you can also select the official Fogra Media Wedge V3 or IDEAlliance Control Strip aim values for paper white, CMYK solids and CMY grey, if the chart contains the right CMYK combinations.</p>

				<h4>How are the results of the profile verification report to be interpreted?</h4>

				<p>This depends on the chart that was measured. The explanation in the first paragraph sums it up pretty well: If you have calibrated and profiled your display, and want to check how well the profile fits a set of measurements (profile accuracy), or if you want to know if your display has drifted and needs to be re-calibrated/re-profiled, you select a chart containing RGB numbers for the verification. Note that directly after profiling, accuracy can be expected to be high if the profile characterizes the display well, which will usually be the case if the display behaviour is not very non-linear, in which case creating a LUT profile instead of a “Curves + matrix” one, or increasing the number of measured patches for LUT profiles, can help.</p>

				<p>If you want to know how well your profile can simulate another colorspace (softproofing), select a reference file containing L*a*b* or XYZ values, like one of the <a href="https://www.fogra.org/mediawedge/">Fogra Media Wedge</a> subsets, or a combination of a simulation profile and testchart. Be warned though, only wide-gamut displays will handle a larger offset printing colorspace like FOGRA39 or similar well enough.</p>

				<p>In both cases, you should check that atleast the nominal tolerances are not exceeded. For a bit “extra safety margin”, look at the recommended values instead.</p>

				<p>Note that both tests are “closed-loop” and will not tell you an “absolute” truth in terms of “color quality” or “color accuracy” as they may not show if your instrument is faulty/measures wrong (a profile created from repeatable wrong measurements will usually still verify well against other wrong measurements from the same instrument if they don't fluctuate too much) or does not cope with your display well (which is especially true for <a href="#colorimeter-corrections">colorimeters and wide-gamut screens</a>, as such combinations need a <a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/ccmxs.html" title="List of contributed colorimeter correction files on the Argyll CMS website">correction</a> in hardware or software to obtain accurate results—this problem does not exist with spectrometers, which do not need a correction for wide-gamut, but have lately been discovered to have issues measuring the correct brightness of some LED backlit displays which use white LEDs), or if colors on your screen match an actual colored object next to it (like a print). It is perfectly possible to obtain good verification results but the actual visual performance being sub-par. It is always wise to combine such measurements with a test of the actual visual appearance via a “known good” reference, like a print or proof (although it should not be forgotten that those also have tolerances, and illumination also plays a big role when assessing visual results). Keep all that in mind when admiring (or pulling your hair out over) verification results :)</p>

				<h4>How are profiles evaluated against the measured values?</h4>

				<p>Different softwares use different methods (which are not always disclosed in detail) to compare and evaluate measurements. This section aims to give interested users a better insight how DisplayCAL's profile verification feature works “under the hood”.</p>

				<h5>How is a testchart or reference file used?</h5>

				<p>There are currently two slightly different paths depending if a testchart or reference file is used for the verification measurements, as outlined above. In both cases, Argyll's <a href="http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/xicclu.html">xicclu</a> utility is run behind the scenes and the values of the testchart or reference file are fed relative colorimetrically (if no whitepoint simualtion is used) or absolute colorimetrically (if whitepoint simulation is used) through the profile that is tested to obtain corresponding L*a*b* (in the case of RGB testcharts) or device RGB numbers (in the case of XYZ or L*a*b* reference files or a combination of simulation profile and testchart). If a combination of simulation profile and testchart is used as reference, the reference L*a*b* values are calculated by feeding the device numbers from the testchart through the simulation profile absolute colorimetrically if whitepoint simulation is enabled (which will be the default if the simulation profile is a printer profile) and relative colorimetrically if whitepoint simulation is disabled (which will be the default if the simulation profile is a display profile, like most RGB working spaces). Then, the original RGB values from the testchart, or the looked up RGB values for a reference are sent to the display through the calibration curves of the profile that is going to be evaluated. A reference white of D50 (ICC default) and complete chromatic adaption of the viewer to the display's whitepoint is assumed if “simulate whitepoint relative to target profile whitepoint” is used, so the measured XYZ values are adapted to D50 (with the measured whitepoint as source reference white) using the Bradford transform (see <a href="http://brucelindbloom.com/Eqn_ChromAdapt.html">Chromatic Adaption</a> on <a href="http://brucelindbloom.com/">Bruce Lindbloom's website</a> for the formula and matrix that is used by DisplayCAL) or with the adaption matrix from the profile in the case of profiles with 'chad' chromatic adaption tag, and converted to L*a*b*. The L*a*b* values are then compared by the generated dynamic report, with user-selectable critera and ΔE (delta E) formula.</p>

				<h5>How is the assumed vs. measured whitepoint ΔE calculated?</h5>

				<p>In a report, the correlated color temperature and assumed target whitepoint, as well as the whitepoint ΔE, do warrant some further explanations: The whitepoint ΔE is calculated as difference between the measured whitepoint's and the assumed target whitepoint's normalized XYZ values, which are first converted to L*a*b*. The assumed target whitepoint color temperature shown is simply the rounded correlated color temparature (100K threshold) calculated from the measured XYZ values. The XYZ values for the assumed target whitepoint are obtained by calculating the chromaticity (xy) coordinates of a CIE D (daylight) or blackbody illuminant of that color temperature and converting them to XYZ. You can find all the used formulas on <a href="http://brucelindbloom.com/">Bruce Lindbloom's website</a> and on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planckian_locus#Approximation">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

				<h5>How is the gray balance “range” evaluated?</h5>

				<p>The gray balance “range” uses a combined delta a/delta b absolute deviation (e.g. if max delta a = -0.5 and max delta b = 0.7, the range is 1.2). Because results in the extreme darks can be problematic due to lack of instrument accuracy and other effects like a black point which has a different chromaticity than the whitepoint, the gray balance check in DisplayCAL only takes into account gray patches with a minimum measured luminance of 1% (i.e. if the white luminance = 120 cd/m², then only patches with at least 1.2 cd/m² will be taken into account).</p>

				<h5>What does the “Evaluate gray balance through calibration only” checkbox on a report actually do?</h5>

				<p>It sets the nominal (target) L* value to the measured L* value and a*=b*=0, so the profile is effectively ignored and only the calibration (if any) will influence the results of the gray balance checks. Note that this option will not make a difference for a “Single curve + matrix” profile, as the single curve effectively already achieves a similar thing (the L* values can be different, but they are ignored for the gray balance checks and only influence the overall result).</p>

				<h3 id="special">Special functionality</h3>
				
				<h4 id="remote">Remote measurements and profiling</h4>
				
				<p>When using Argyll CMS 1.4.0 and newer, remote measurements on a device not directly connected to the machine that is running DisplayCAL is possible (e.g. a smartphone or tablet). The remote device needs to be able to run a web browser (Firefox recommended), and the local machine running DisplayCAL may need firewall rules added or altered to allow incoming connections. To set up remote profiling, select “Web @ localhost” from the display device dropdown menu, then choose the desired action (e.g. “Profile only”). When the message “Webserver waiting at http://&lt;IP&gt;:&lt;Port&gt;” appears, open the shown address in the remote browser and attach the measurement device.<br />
				<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you use this method of displaying test patches, there is no access to the display video <abbr title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></abbr>s and hardware calibration is not possible. The colors will be displayed with 8 bit per component precision, and any screen-saver or power-saver will not be automatically disabled. You will also be at the mercy of any color management applied by the web browser, and may have to carefully review and configure such color management.<br />
				<strong>Note:</strong> Close the web browser window or tab after each run, otherwise reconnection may fail upon further runs.</p>

				<h4 id="madvr">madVR test pattern generator</h4>

				<p>DisplayCAL supports the <a href="http://madvr.com/">madVR</a> test pattern generator (madTPG) and madVR 3D LUT formats since version 1.5.2.5 when used together with Argyll CMS 1.6.0 or newer.</p>

				<h4 id="resolve">Resolve (10.1+) as pattern generator</h4>

				<p>Since version 2.5, DisplayCAL can use <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve">Resolve</a> (10.1+) as pattern generator. Select the “Resolve” entry from the display devices dropdown in DisplayCAL and in Resolve itself choose “Monitor calibration”, “CalMAN” in the “Color” menu.</p>

				<h4 id="untethered">Untethered display measurements</h4>
				
				<p><em>Please note that the untethered mode should generally only be used if you've exhausted all other options.</em></p>
				
				<p>Untethered mode is another option to measure and profile a remote display that is not connected via standard means (calibration is not supported). To use untethered mode, the testchart that should be used needs to be optimized, then exported as image files (via the testchart editor) and those image files need to be displayed on the device that should be measured, in successive order. The procedure is as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Select the desired testchart, then open the testchart editor.</li>
					<li>Select “Optimize for untethered in auto mode” from the sorting options dropdown, click “Apply”, then export the testchart.</li>
					<li>Burn the images to a DVD, copy them on an USB stick or use any other available means to get them to display onto the device that should be measured.</li>
					<li>In DisplayCAL's display dropdown, select “Untethered” (the last option).</li>
					<li>Show the first image on the remote display, and attach the instrument. Then select “Profile only”.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Measurements will commence, and changes in the displayed image should be automatically detected if “auto” mode is enabled. Use whatever means available to you to cycle through the images from first to last, carefully monitoring the measurement process and only changing to the next image if the current one has been successfully measured (as will be shown in the untethered measurement window). Note that untethered mode will be (atleast) twice as slow as normal display measurements.</p>

					<dt>Show advanced options</dt>
						<dd>Enabling this menu option will show some additional controls and menu options for advanced users.</dd>

					<dt>Advanced › Use separate video card gamma table acccess</dt>
						<dd>Because of the difficulty caused by TwinView and MergedFB in X11 based systems, you can optionally specify a separate display for accessing the video card gamma table hardware during calibration. You may be able to calibrate one screen, and then share the calibration with another screen. Profiling can be done independently to calibration on each screen. Normally DisplayCAL will automatically detect if separate video card gamma table access is needed (and appropriate controls need to be displayed), but you may force it by selecting this menu entry.</dd>

					<dt>Advanced › Do not use  video card gamma table to apply calibration</dt>
						<dd>Calibration will be applied to the test values for each measurement instead of being loaded into the video card gamma table, and also included in measurement data files, so that the profiler can include it as a vcgt tag in the resulting profile. This is <strong>not</strong> normally the best way to profile a calibrated display, since the frame buffer may have lower precision than the video card gamma table. This is the way calibration should be applied if <a href="http://madvr.com/">madVR</a> is being used to display the test patches.</dd>

					<dt>Advanced › Skip legacy serial ports</dt>
						<dd>Skips serial (non-USB) ports while enumerating instruments.</dd>

					<dt>Advanced › Allow skipping of spectrometer self-calibration</dt>
						<dd>Spectrometers require a sensor calibration before measurements. If this option is checked, DisplayCAL will try to skip this sensor calibration. <em>Note</em> even if this option is checked, you may be forced to do a sensor calibration if the instrument requires it.</dd>

The purchaser of a Spyder 2 instrument should have received a copy of this firmware along with their instrument from the original vendor, as part of the instrument setup files.<br />
On Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X, if the vendors software has been installed on the users machine, the firmware pattern can usually automatically be located from there. If the vendors software have not been installed, or the user does not wish to install it, or no vendors software are available for the users platform (i.e. Linux), then the Spyder 2 installation CDROM will also be searched if present. In case no firmware files are found, the necessary binary can be downloaded automatically.</dd>

If they are installed or the CD / disk image is mounted, the correct file(s) can in most cases be imported directly, otherwise they can be downloaded automatically. Please note: The colorimeter corrections imported from Spyder 4/5 software are only usable with the Spyder 4/5 and need to be selected in the measurement mode dropdown instead of the colorimeter corrections dropdown.</dd>


					<dt id="create-colorimeter-correction">Correction › Create colorimeter correction...</dt>
						<dd>Allows you to create correction matrices for all colorimeters as well as spectral corrections for i1 Display Pro, ColorMunki Display and Spyder 4/5.
						You first need to measure the required test colors with a spectrometer, and in case you want to create a correction matrix instead of a spectral correction, also with the colorimeter. A checkmark next to the “Measure” buttons indicates previous measurements already being present (it is recommended that measurements be recent though, so ideally both spectrometer and colorimeter measurements should be performed whenever a colorimeter correction matrix is to be created). Alternatively you can also use existing measurements by choosing “Browse...”.

						<dd>Run verify measurements on the selected display as it is currently setup (ie. video card gamma table). This will use the usual input parameters to establish the expected (target) characteristic. Note that if the initial calibration was modified due to it being out of gamut of the display, verify will show the resulting discrepancy.</dd>

					<dt>Report › Measure display device uniformity...</dt>
						<dd>Measure the display at several points to evaluate evenness of illumination and color errors. The results are shown after all patches are measured, and include the luminance difference, delta E 2000, CCT (correlated color temperature), and CDT (closest daylight temperature) or CPT (closest planckian temperature) depending on the selection for the whitepoint locus set on the “Calibration” tab. Differences are computed in comparison to the center point, which is used as reference.<br />
						The evaluation is done according to ISO 12646:2015. A checkmark means the ISO criteria have been met (delta E of equal or less than 4, luminance difference of less than 10%). Two checkmarks mean that both the ISO criteria as well as twice as strict tolerances have been met (delta E of equal or less than 2, luminance difference of less than 5%). You can switch between delta E, delta C, delta H and delta L by clicking the labels.</dd>

					<dt>Report › Update measurement report...</dt>
						<dd>This allows to update an existing report HTML file with the template and functionality from a newer version of DisplayCAL (no measurements involved).

			<h2>Scripting</h2>
			
			<p>DisplayCAL supports scripting locally and over the network (the latter must be explicitly enabled by setting <code>app.allow_network_clients = 1</code> in DisplayCAL.ini) via sockets. DisplayCAL must be already running on the target machine for this to work. Below is an example connecting to a running instance on the default port <code>15411</code> and starting calibration measurements (the port is configurable in DisplayCAL.ini as <code>app.port</code>, although if the desired port is not available an unused one will be chosen automatically. You can read the actual used port from the file DisplayCAL.lock in the <a href="#configuration">configuration</a> file folder of DisplayCAL while it is running). The example is written in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and deals with some of the intricacies of sockets as well.</p>

			<p>Each command needs to be terminated with a newline character (after any arguments the command may accept). Note that data sent must be UTF-8 encoded, and if arguments contain spaces they should be encased in double or single quotes. You should check the response for each command sent (the response end marker is ASCII 0x4 EOT, and the default <a href="#scripting.commands.setresponseformat">response format</a> is a plain text format, but JSON and XML are also available). The common return values for commands are either <code>ok</code> in case the command was understood (note that this does not indicate if the command finished processing), <code>busy</code> or <code>blocked</code> in case the command was ignored because another operation was running or a modal dialog blocks the UI, <code>failed</code> in case the command or an argument could not be processed successfully, <code>forbidden</code> in case the command was not allowed (this may be a temporary condition depending on the circumstances, e.g. when trying to interact with an UI element that is currently disabled), <code>invalid</code> in case the command (or one of its arguments) was invalid, or <code>error</code> followed by an error message in case of an unhandled exception. Other return values are possible depending on the command. All values returned are UTF-8 encoded. If the return value is <code>blocked</code> (e.g. because a modal dialog is displayed) you should check the <a href="#scripting.commands.getstate">application state</a> with the <code><a href="#scripting.commands.getstate">getstate</a></code> command to determine the further course of action.</p>

			<h3>Interacting with UI elements</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Invoking a button: <code><a href="#scripting.commands.interact">interact</a> [window] &lt;button&gt;</code> e.g. show profile name placeholders information: <code><a href="#scripting.commands.interact">interact</a> mainframe profile_name_info_btn</code></li>
				<li>Setting a value on a dropdown, text field, or slider: <code><a href="#scripting.commands.interact">interact</a> [window] &lt;element&gt; setvalue "value"</code> e.g. set calibration gamma to 2.4: <code><a href="#scripting.commands.interact">interact</a> mainframe trc_textctrl setvalue 2.4</code> (note that for changing multiple options at once it is generally preferable to call <code><a href="#scripting.commands.setcfg">setcfg</a> &lt;option&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code> for each option you want to set followed by a single <code><a href="#scripting.commands.refresh">refresh</a></code> instead)</li>
				<li>Setting a cell value on a grid: <code><a href="#scripting.commands.interact">interact</a> [window] &lt;grid&gt; setvalue "row,col,value"</code> e.g. while the testchart editor is shown, set the cell at the second column of the first row to 33: <code><a href="#scripting.commands.interact">interact</a> tcgen grid setvalue "0,1,33"</code></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Caveats and limitations</h3>
			
			<p>There are a few things to be aware of when using commands that interact with the UI directly (i.e. <code><a href="#scripting.commands.activate">activate</a></code>, <code><a href="#scripting.commands.dialogactions">alt | cancel | ok</a></code>, <code><a href="#scripting.commands.close">close</a></code>, <code><a href="#scripting.commands.interact">interact</a></code> and <code><a href="#scripting.commands.invokemenu">invokemenu</a></code>).</p>
			
			<p><strong>Referring to windows and UI elements:</strong> You can refer to windows and UI elements by their ID, name or label (you can find out about windows and UI elements with the <code><a href="#scripting.commands.getmenus">getmenus</a></code>/<code><a href="#scripting.commands.getmenuitems">getmenuitems</a></code>, <code><a href="#scripting.commands.getuielement">getuielement</a></code>/<code><a href="#scripting.commands.getuielements">getuielements</a></code>, and <code><a href="#scripting.commands.getwindows">getwindows</a></code> commands). If an object's ID is negative, it means that it has been automatically assigned at object creation time and is only valid during the lifetime of the object (i.e. for modal dialogs, only while the dialog is displayed). For this reason, using an object's name instead is easier, but names (aswell as non automatically assigned IDs) are not guaranteed to be unique, even for objects which share the same parent window (although most of the “important” controls as well as application windows will have unique names). Another possibility is to use an object's label, which while also not guaranteed to be unique, still has a fairly high likelihood of being unique for controls that share the same parent window, but has the drawback that it is localized (although you can ensure a specific UI language by calling <code><a href="#scripting.commands.setlanguage">setlanguage</a></code>) and is subject to change when the localization is updated.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Sequential operations:</strong> Calling commands that interact with the UI in rapid succession may require the use of additional delays between sending commands to allow the GUI to react (so <code><a href="#scripting.commands.getstate">getstate</a></code> will return the actual UI state after a specific command), although there is a default delay for commands that interact with the UI of atleast 55 ms. A good rule of thumb for sending commands is to use a “send command” → “read response” → “optionally wait a few extra ms” → “get application state (send <code><a href="#scripting.commands.getstate">getstate</a></code> command)” → “read response” cycle.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Setting values:</strong> If setting a value on an UI element returns <code>ok</code>, this is not always an indication that the value was actually changed, but only that the attempt to set the value has not failed, i.e. the event handler of the element may still do error checking and change the value to something sane if it was not valid. If you want to make sure that the intended value is set, use <code><a href="#scripting.commands.getuielement">getuielement</a></code> on the affected element(s) and check the value (or even better, if you use <a href="#scripting.commands.setresponseformat">JSON or XML response format</a>, you can check the <code>object</code> property/element of the response instead which will reflect the object's current state and saves you one request). In general it is preferable to use <code><a href="#scripting.commands.interact">interact</a> &lt;elementname&gt; setvalue &lt;value&gt;</code> only on dialogs, and in all other cases use a sequence of <code><a href="#scripting.commands.setcfg">setcfg</a> &lt;option&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code> (repeat as necessary, optionally call <code><a href="#scripting.commands.load">load</a> &lt;filename&gt;</code> or <code><a href="#scripting.commands.restore-defaults">restore-defaults</a></code> first to minimize the amount of configuration options that you need to change) followed by a call to <code><a href="#scripting.commands.refresh">refresh</a></code> to update the UI.</p>
			
			<p>Also, not all controls may offer a comprehensive scripting interface. I'm open to suggestions though.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt id="issue-redgreenswapped"><span>General:</span> Wacky image colors (swapped colors)</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> This happens when you created a “XYZ LUT + swapped matrix” profile and is a way to alert you that the software you're using does not support XYZ LUT profiles and falls back to the included matrix (which generally means you'd loose accuracy). If you're having this situation only in some applications, creating a “XYZ LUT + matrix” profile will remedy it (but please keep in mind that those applications not supporting XYZ LUT will still fall back to the matrix, so results can be different from applications that support XYZ LUT correctly). If all colormanaged applications you use show swapped colors, you should create a matrix profile instead. Note that you do not have to re-run any measurements: In DisplayCAL, choose a profile type as suggested previously (you need to enable advanced options in the “Options” menu to show profile type choices on the “Profiling” tab), adjust quality and profile name if you want, then choose “Create profile from measurement data...” in the “Options” menu and select the profile you had the issue with.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-samplereadfail"><span>General:</span> Measurements are failing (“Sample read failed”) if using the “Allow skipping of spectrometer self-calibration” option and/or highres/adaptive mode</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Disable either or all of the above options. The problem seems to mainly occur with the ColorMunki.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-usb3connectivity"><span>USB 3.0</span> connectivity issues (instrument not found, access failing, or not working properly)</dt>
				<dd>Such issues would usually manifest themselves through instruments not being found, or randomly disconnecting even if seemingly working fine for some time. From all information that is known about these issues, they seem to be related to USB 3.0, not related to software as the vendor software is also affected, and they seem to occur irrespective of operating system or device drivers.<br />
The underlying issue seems to be that while USB 3.0 has been designed to be backwards compatible with USB 2.0, some USB 2 devices do not seem to work reliably when connected over USB 3. As currently available instruments with USB connectivity are usually USB 2 devices, they may be affected.<br />
<strong>Solution:</strong> A potential solution to such USB 3.0 connectivity issues is to connect the instrument to a USB 2.0 port (if available) or the use of an externally powered USB 2.0 hub.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-win-process-startfail"><span>Windows:</span> “The process &lt;dispcal.exe|dispread.exe|coloprof.exe|...&gt; could not be started.”</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> If you downloaded Argyll CMS manually, go to your Argyll_VX.X.X\bin directory, and right-click the exe file from the error message. Select “Properties”, and then if there is a text on the “General” tab under security “This file came from another computer and might be blocked”, click “Unblock”. Sometimes also over-zealous Antivirus or 3rd-party Firewall solutions cause such errors, and you may have to add exceptions for all involved programs (which may include all the Argyll CMS executables and if you're using Zero Install also python.exe which you'll find in a subdirectory under C:\ProgramData\0install.net\implementations) or (temporarily) disable the Antivirus/Firewall.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-win-photoshop-monprofdefect"><span>Photoshop:</span> “The monitor profile […] appears to be defective. Please rerun your monitor calibration software.”</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Adobe ACE, Adobe's color conversion engine, contains monitor profile validation functionality which attempts to filter out bad profiles. With XYZ LUT profiles created in Argyll CMS versions up to 1.3.2, the B2A white point mapping is sometimes not particularly accurate, just enough so that ACE will see it as a problem, but in actual use it may only have little impact that the whitepoint is a bit off. So if you get a similar message when launching Photoshop, with the options “Use profile regardless” and “Ignore profile”, you may choose “Use profile regardless” and check visually or with the pipette in Photoshop if the inaccurate whitepoint poses a problem. This issue is fixed in Argyll CMS 1.3.3 and newer. Alternatively, you can create a L*a*b* LUT profile.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-win-uac-cal-reset"><span>MS Windows Vista:</span> The calibration gets unloaded when a User Access Control prompt is shown</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> (Intel and Intel/AMD hybrid graphics users please see <a href="#issue-win-intel-cal-reset">“The Calibration gets unloaded after login/resume/User Access Control prompt”</a> first) This Windows Vista bug seems to have been fixed under Windows 7 (and later), and can be remedied under Vista by either manually reloading calibration, or disabling UAC—but please note that you sacrifice security by doing this. To manually reload the calibration, either open DisplayCAL and select “Load calibration curves from current display profile” under the “Video card gamma table” sub-menu in the “Tools” menu, or (quicker) open the Windows start menu and select “DisplayCAL Profile Loader” in the “Startup” subfolder. To disable <abbr title="User Access Control">UAC<sup><a href="#definition_UAC">[9]</a></sup></abbr> (not recommended!), open the Windows start menu and enter “msconfig” in the search box. Click on the Tools tab. Select the line “Disable UAC” and click the “Launch” button. Close msconfig. You need to reboot your system for changes to apply.</dd>
				
				<dt id="issue-win-intel-cal-reset"><span>MS Windows with Intel graphics (also Intel/AMD hybrid):</span> The Calibration gets unloaded after login/resume/User Access Control prompt</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> The Intel graphics drivers contain several utilities that interfere with correct calibration loading. A workaround is to rename, move or disable (e.g. using a tool like <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902">AutoRuns</a>) the following files:
				<pre><code>C:\Windows\system32\igfxtray.exe
C:\Windows\system32\igfxpph.dll
C:\Windows\system32\igfxpers.exe</code></pre></dd>

				<dt id="issue-win-user-profile-not-used"><span>MS Windows Vista and later:</span> The display profile isn't used if it was installed for the current user</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Open the Windows start menu, select “Control Panel”, then “Color Management” (you may have to select “Classic View” under Vista and anything other than “Category View” under Windows 7 and later to see it). Under the “Devices” tab, select your display device, then tick “Use my settings for this device”.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-win7-autoloadcalibration"><span>MS Windows 7 or later:</span> Calibration does not load automatically on login when not using the DisplayCAL Profile Loader</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Open the Windows start menu, select “Control Panel”, then “Color Management” (you may have to select something other than “Category View” to see it). Select the “Advanced” tab, then “Change system defaults...”, and finally tick the “Use Windows display calibration” checkbox. <strong>Note</strong> that the precision of Windows' built-in calibration loading is <strong>inferior</strong> compared to the DisplayCAL profile loader and may introduce inaccuracies and artifacts.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-winxp-multidisplay"><span>MS Windows XP, multiple displays:</span> One profile is used by all displays connected to a graphics card</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> The underlying issue is that Windows XP assigns color profiles per (logical) graphics card, not per output. Most XP graphics drivers present only one logical card to the OS even if the card itself has multiple outputs. There are several possible solutions to this problem:
					<ul>
						<li>Use different graphics cards and connect only one display to each (this is probably the preferable solution in terms of ease of use and is least prone to configuration error)</li>
						<li>Install and use the <a href="https://displaycal.net/files/WinColorSetup.exe">Windows XP color control applet</a> (note that the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=1e33dca0-7721-43ca-9174-7f8d429fbb9e">original MS download link</a> is down)</li>
						<li>Some graphics cards, like the Matrox Parhelia APV (no longer produced), will expose two logical cards to the OS when using a specific vendor driver (some older ATI drivers also had this feature, but it seems to have been removed from newer ones)</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>

				<dt id="issue-mac-dispcalgui-0install-elcapitan"><span>Mac OS X:</span> If running via 0install, DisplayCAL won't launch anymore under Mac OS X 10.11 “El Capitan”</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong>

					<ol>
						<li>Run the “0install Launcher” application from the DisplayCAL-0install.dmg disk image.</li>
						<li>Click “Refresh”, then “Run”. An updated library will be downloaded, and DisplayCAL should launch.</li>
						<li>From now on, you can start DisplayCAL normally as usual.</li>
					</ol>
				</dd>

				<dt id="issue-mac-dispcalgui-damaged"><span>Mac OS X:</span> DisplayCAL.app is damaged and can't be opened.</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Go to the “Security &amp; Privacy” settings in System Preferences and set “Allow applications downloaded from” (under the “General” tab) to the “Anywhere” setting. After you have successfully launched DisplayCAL, you can change the setting back to a more secure option and DisplayCAL will continue to run properly.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-mac-pscursor"><span>Photoshop CS3 (Mac OS X):</span> Under Mac OS X, the brush cursor in Photoshop CS3 looks funny (box around brush)</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> This seems to be a bug which shows with <abbr title="Look Up Table">LUT<sup><a href="#definition_LUT">[7]</a></sup></abbr>-type profiles that have only one rendering intent. You can try to overcome it by selecting “Advanced...” next to the profile type dropdown, selecting an existing <abbr title="International Color Consortium">ICC<sup><a href="#definition_ICC">[5]</a></sup></abbr> profile as source (for hints as to which profile to select, see  “<a href="#settings_profiling_gamutmapping">Advanced gamut mapping options</a>”) and tick at least one of the “Enhance effective resolution of colorimetric <abbr title="Profile Connection Space">PCS<sup><a href="#definition_PCS">[11]</a></sup></abbr>-to-device table” or “Apply gamut mapping to” checkboxes before profiling. To do that for an existing profile, adjust quality and profile name if you want, choose “Create profile from measurement data...” from the “File” menu and select the profile. Note that this does not always solve the issue. Trying another profile type (XYZ LUT instead of L*a*b* LUT) might also help.</dd>				

				<dt id="issue-linux-lutaccess"><span>Linux/Windows:</span> No video card gamma table access (“Calibrate only” and “Calibrate &amp; profile” buttons grayed, “Profile only” button available)</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> Make sure you have not selected a display that doesn't support calibration (i.e. “Web @ localhost” or “Untethered”) and that you have enabled “Interactive display adjustment” or set the tone curve to a different value than “As measured”. Under Linux, please refer to the Argyll CMS documentation, “<a href="http://argyllcms.com/doc/Installing_Linux.html">Installing the software on Linux with X11</a>” and “Note on X11 multi-monitor setups” / “Fixing access to Video LUTs” therein. Under Windows, please also see the solution posted under “<a href="#issue-win-user-profile-not-used">The display profile isn't used if it was installed for the current user</a>” if you are using Windows and make sure you have a recent driver for your video card installed.</dd>

				<dt id="issue-linux-libmtp"><span>Linux:</span> Instrument not working correctly/constantly disconnecting (conflict with libmtp)</dt>
				<dd><strong>Solution:</strong> There is a bug on some systems with libmtp that causes instruments to continuously switch between connected and disconnected state.
				This seems to be a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=626010">bug in libmtp-runtime</a>.
				You can work around it by renaming <code>/lib/udev/mtp-probe</code> or updating to libmtp 1.0.6 where the issue should be fixed.</dd>

			<h2>Report a bug</h2>

			<p>Found a bug? If so, please first check the <a href="https://displaycal.net/issues/">issue tracker</a>, it may have been reported already.
			Otherwise, please follow these guidelines for reporting bugs:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Try to give a <strong>short, but concise summary of the problem</strong>.</li>
				<li>Try to give some <strong>steps to reproduce the problem</strong>.</li>
				<li>Always <strong>attach logfiles</strong> if possible. They are usually automatically created by DisplayCAL as part of normal program operation. If you're having a problem with a particular instrument, it would be great if you could do a run with Argyll CMS debug output enabled in the “Advanced” sub-menu under the “Options” menu to generate a more verbose debug log - note that you have to enable advanced options first.<br />
The easiest way to get a complete set of logfiles is to choose “Show log” from the “Tools” menu and then click the “Create compressed archive...” button on the log window (<strong>not</strong> the “Save as...” button as this will only save the session log). You can also find the logfiles here:
					<ul>
						<li>Linux:
							<samp>/home/<var>Your Username</var>/.local/share/DisplayCAL/logs</samp></li>
						<li>Mac OS X:
							<samp>/Users/<var>Your Username</var>/Library/Logs/DisplayCAL</samp> and<br />

					</ul>
					<p><strong>Note</strong> that if you have upgraded to DisplayCAL from dispcalGUI, that DisplayCAL will continue to use the existing dispcalGUI directories (so replace DisplayCAL with dispcalGUI in the locations above).</p>

			<h2>To-Do / planned features (in no particular order)</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>On first launch, guide user through basic setup using a wizard (postpone DisplayCAL update check until after wizard has run?):
					<ul>
						<li><del>Check Argyll CMS availability, if not available or outdated, offer automatic download &amp; installation (consider 0install/native Linux distribution packages?)</del> (implemented)</li>
						<li>Windows only: Install instrument drivers if necessary (probably need to check if already installed)</li>
						<li>Check available instruments and instrument capabilities</li>
						<li>Do instrument specific first launch stuff:
							<ul>
								<li><del>Import OEM files</del> (implemented)</li>
								<li>Choose/create colorimeter correction if applicable</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>When an instrument is first selected:
					<ul>
						<li><del>Check if OEM files from the vendor software have already been imported (if applicable); if not, offer to do it.</del> (implemented in v2.1.1.3 Beta and newer, after detecting instruments)</li>
						<li>Check colorimeter corrections if applicable (from respective vendor software and online database, skip the latter if a spectro is available), in case of no usable specific or generic correction, offer to create one if possible, preferably using spectro measurements as reference, EDID as user-selectable fallback? (Need to sanity-check EDID red/green/blue/white xy coordinates in that case! Possibly against sRGB and AdobeRGB as the most commonly cited gamuts for standard gamut and wide-gamut displays? As some cheaper panels and many of those found in Laptops/Notebooks are sometimes very limited in gamut, additionally a special “low-gamut RGB” may be needed)</li>
						<li>Users need to be made aware of the implications their colorimeter correction choice has, e.g.
							<ul>
								<li>When using a correction created from spectral reference measurements of the specific display (user needs a spectro): Usually very good accuracy/match to user's specific display/instrument combination</li>
								<li>When using a vendor-supplied generic correction: Good (?) (e.g. i1 DisplayPro, ColorMunki Display) to poor (?) (e.g. i1 Display 1/2/LT, Huey, ColorHug) accuracy/match to user's specific display/instrument combination, in case of CCSS considered preferable to corrections supplied by other users because of lab-grade equipment (high spectral resolution) used by vendor.</li>
								<li>When using a correction supplied by another user for the same display/instrument combination: Good (?) (e.g. i1 DisplayPro, ColorMunki Display, DTP94) to poor (?) (e.g. i1 Display 1/2/LT, Huey, ColorHug) accuracy/match to user's specific display/instrument combination</li>
								<li>When using EDID of the specific display as reference: Moderate (?) to poor (?) accuracy/match to user's specific display/instrument combination (could be ok match, could be awful, but should in most cases still be able to fix problems like e.g. ColorHug red sensitivity so may be ok as last resort)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><del>When trying to import colorimeter corrections or enable the Spyder 2, have automatic mode download the vendor software if needed.</del> (implemented in v2.1.1.2 Beta and newer)</li>
				<li>(Long-term) improve UI.</li>
				<li><del>Better interface to <a href="https://github.com/GNOME/gnome-color-manager">GNOME Color Manager</a></del> (implemented in v0.8.1.0+)</li>
				<li><del>Measure and report on screen homogenity / evenness of illumination</del></li>
				<li><del>Get rid of the terminal and implement a proper GUI for the interactive part of calibration</del> (implemented in v0.8.5.6+)</li>
				<li><del>Better user interface for profile verification: If a test set contains multiple value formats (CMYK, RGB, XYZ, L*a*b*), allow selection which one(s) should be used in a “setup” window</del> (“setup” window implemented in v1.5.6.9+, value format selection added in v1.6.3.5)</li>
				<li>Add gamut coverage percentages to the profile verification report if the test set contains reference values (not *.ti1): Calculate profiles from test set and verification measurements on-the-fly and create gamut volumes from test set profile, evaluated profile, and verification measurements profile using Argyll's <code>iccgamut</code> tool. Compare gamut volumes using Argyll's <code>viewgam</code> tool with <code>-i</code> option and include the results in the report (coverage calculation for test set reference and profile to be evaluated could be done before the actual measurements and also shown in the yet-to-be-implemented profile verification “setup” window).</li>
				<li><del>Complete the documentation in the README</del></li>
				<li>German language README (postponed)</li>
				<li><del>Profile verification (feed XYZ or L*a*b* to display profile, display 
					corresponding RGB values, measure, output Delta E)</del> (implemented in v0.3.6+)</li>
				<li><del>“Before” / “After” switch when calibration / profiling complete</del> (implemented in v0.2+)</li>
				<li><del>Store all settings in profile, allow loading of settings from profile in 
					addition to <code>.cal</code> file</del> (implemented in v0.2+)</li>
				<li><del>Document the code</del> (code documentation could still be enhanced, for now it'll do)</li>
				<li><del>Code cleanup</del> (mostly done)</li>

					<dd>
						<h3>3.2.4 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Korean translation thanks to 김환(Howard Kim).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Disable observer selection if observer is set by a colorimeter correction.</li>
							<li>3D LUT maker: Enable black output offset choice for 16-bit table-based source profiles.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): “Automatically fix profile associations” is now enabled by default.</li>
							<li>Build system: Filter out “build”, “dist” as well as entries starting with a dot (“.”) to speed up traversing the source directory tree (distutils/setuptools hack).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Could not create colorimeter correction from existing measurements for instruments that don't support alternative standard observers.</li>
							<li>ColorHug / ColorHug2 “Auto” measurement mode threw an error if the extended display identification data did not contain a model name.</li>
							<li>[Trivial/cosmetic] Testchart editor: When adding reference patches, resize row labels if needed.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Linux): When errors occured during calibration loading, there was no longer any message popup.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Filter non-existing profiles (e.g. ones that have been deleted via Windows Explorer without first disassociating them from the display device) from the list of associated profiles (same behavior as Windows color management settings).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): When changing the language on-the-fly via DisplayCAL, update primary display device identfier string.</li>
						</ul>

						<p id="changelog-3.2.3">2017-01-04 14:10 (UTC) 3.2.3 </p>
						<h3>3.2.3 </h3>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated traditional chinese translation (thanks to 楊添明).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): When creating the profile loader launcher task, set it to stop existing instance of the task when launching to circumvent a possible Windows bug where a task would not start even if no previous instance was running.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When querying the online colorimeter corrections database for matching corrections, only query for corrections with a matching manufacturer ID in addition to a matching display model name (fixes corrections being offered for displays from different manufacturers, but matching model names).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Fix unhandled exception if no profile is assigned to a display (regression of a change to show the profile description instead of just the file name in DisplayCAL 3.2.1).</li>
						</ul>
				
						<p id="changelog-3.2.2">2016-12-13 22:27 (UTC) 3.2.2 </p>
						<h3>3.2.2 </h3>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Importing colorimeter corrections from other display profiling software now only imports from the explicitly selected entries in automatic mode.</li>
							<li>Profile loader launcher (Windows): Pass through <code>--oneshot</code> argument to profile loader.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Visual whitepoint editor: Opening a second editor on the same display without first dragging the previously opened editor to another display would overwrite the cached profile association for the current display with the visual whitepoint editor temporary profile, thus preventing the correct profile association being restored when the editor was closed.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: Fall back to HTTP when downloading X3D viewer components to work around broken Python TLS support.</li>
							<li>Windows: When installing instrument drivers, catch WMI errors while trying to query device hardware IDs for instruments.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Possibility of unhandled exception when resuming from sleep if the graphics chipset is an Intel integrated HD graphics with more than one attached display device (may affect other graphics chipsets as well).</li>
						</ul>

						<p id="changelog-3.2.1">2016-11-25 13:35 (UTC) 3.2.1 </p>
						<h3>3.2.1 </h3>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows Vista and later): The profile loader process now auto-starts with the highest available privileges if installed as administrator. This allows changing system default profile associations whenever logged in with administrative privileges.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows Vista and later): If running under a restricted user account and using system defaults, clicking any of the “Add...”, “Remove” and “Set as default” buttons will allow to restart the profile loader with elevated privileges.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Show profile description in addition to profile file name in profile associations dialog.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Linux, Windows: Visual whitepoint editor was not working in HiDPI mode.</li>
							<li>Windows: Irritating “File not found” error after installing a profile with special characters in the profile name (note that the profile was installed regardless).</li>
							<li>[Cosmetic] Standalone executables (Windows): In HiDPI mode, taskbar and task switcher icons could be showing placeholders due to missing icon files.</li>
							<li>[Minor] Profile loader (Windows): Enable the profile associations dialog “Add...” button irrespective of the current list of profiles being empty.</li>
							<li>[Minor] Profile loader (Windows): Suppress error message when trying to remove a profile from the active display device if the profile is the system default for said device (and thus cannot be removed unless running as administrator) but not for the current one.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Do not fail to close profile information windows if the profile associations dialog has already been closed.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): If logging into another user account with different DPI settings while keeping the original session running, then logging out of the other account and returning to the original session, the profile loader could deadlock.</li>
						</ul>

						<p id="changelog-3.2">2016-11-19 11:01 (UTC) 3.2 </p>
						<h3>3.2 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Visual whitepoint editor.</strong> This allows visually adjusting the whitepoint on display devices that lack hardware controls as well as match several displays to one another (or a reference). To use it, set the whitepoint to “Chromaticity” on the “Calibration” tab and click the visual whitepoint editor button (you can open as many visual whitepoint editors simultaneously as you like, so that e.g. one can be left unchanged as reference, while the other can be adjusted to match said reference). The editor window can be put into a distraction-free fullscreen mode by maximizing it (press ESC to leave fullscreen again). Adjust the whitepoint using the controls on the editor tool pane until you have achieved a visual match. Then, place your instrument on the measurement area and click “Measure”. The measured whitepoint will be set as calibration target.</li>
							<li>Another “Auto” testchart slider step with 154 patches (equal to small testchart for LUT profiles) for XYZ LUT + matrix profile type.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Menu overhaul.</strong> Menus are now better organized using categorized sub-menus and some menu items have been moved to more appropriate locations:
								<ul>
									<li>The “Options” menu no longer contains any functionality besides actual options. Advanced options have been moved to a sub-menu.</li>
									<li>Profile creation from existing measurement files or EDID, profile installation as well as profile upload (sharing) functionality can now be found in the “File” menu.</li>
									<li>Most functionality available in the “Tools” menu has been grouped into categorized sub-menus, with some of the less-used functionality now available under a separate “Advanced” sub-menu.</li>
									<li>Measuring the selected testchart, enhancing the effective resolution of a colorimetric PCS-to-device table, loading calibration and resetting the video card gamma tables, detecting displays &amp; instruments, as well as user-initiated spectrometer self-calibration functionality has been moved to the “Tools” menu and respective sub-menus where applicable.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Changed default curves + matrix profile testchart as well as first “Auto” testchart slider step back to pre-3.1.7 chart with 73 patches.</li>
							<li><strong>Better curves + matrix profiles as well as faster computation of XYZ LUT + matrix profiles.</strong> The matrix and shaper curves of gamma + matrix, curves + matrix as well as XYZ LUT + matrix profiles are now generated in separate steps which improves the shape and grayscale neutrality of the curves on less well-behaved displays. XYZ LUT + matrix profiles will compute faster, because the curves and matrix are created from a sub-set of the profiling patches, and take around the same time as XYZ LUT + swapped matrix profiles, resulting in a typical overall computation speed increase of around +33% (+100% if just looking at the time needed when not creating PCS-to-device tables) for a XYZ LUT + matrix profile computed from 1148 patches. XYZ LUT + matrix profiles computed from more patches should see a larger computation speed increase of up to +100% depending on patch count.</li>
							<li>Resolve pattern generator and non-native madVR network implementation: Determine the computer's local network IP address in a way that is hopefully more reliable across platforms.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Detect and work-around buggy Intel video drivers which, despite reverting to linear gamma tables at certain points (e.g. UAC prompts), will effectively ignore attempts to restore the gamma table calibration if it is considered to be already loaded by the driver.</li>
							<li><strong>Profile loader (Windows): Replaced “Open Windows color management settings...” pop-up menu item with own “Profile associations...” implementation.</strong> This should work better with multi-display configurations in contrast to Windows' braindead built-in counterpart, i.e. display devices will be listed under their EDID name (if available) as well as their viewport position and size on the virtual desktop and not only their often meaningless generic driver name like “PnP-Monitor”. Also, there won't be multiple entries for the same display device or ambiguous “1|2” identifications if there are display devices that are currently not part of the desktop due to being disabled in Windows display settings. Changing profile associations around is of course still using Windows color management functionality, but the custom UI will look and act more sane than what Windows color management settings has to offer.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Clicking the task bar tray icon will now always show up-to-date (at the time of clicking) information in the notification popup even if the profile loader is disabled.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Starting a new instance of the profile loader will now always attempt to close an already running instance instead of just notifying it, allowing for easy re-starting.</li>
							<li>Windows (Vista and later): Installing a profile as system default will now automatically turn off “Use my settings for this device” for the current user, so that if the system default profile is changed by another user, the change is propagated to all users that have opted to use the system default profile (which is the whole point of installing a profile as system default).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Spectrometer self-calibration using an i1 Pro or i1 Pro 2 with Argyll &gt;= 1.9 always presented the emissive dark calibration dialog irrespective of measurement mode (but still correctly did a reflective calibration if the measurement mode was one of the high resolution spectrum modes).</li>
							<li>User-initiated spectrometer self-calibration was not performed if “Allow skipping of spectrometer self-calibration” was enabled in the “Options” menu and the most recent self-calibration was still fresh.</li>
							<li>Cosmetic: If an update check, colorimeter correction query or profile sharing upload returned a HTTP status code equal to or greater than 400 (server-side error), an unhandled exception was raised instead of presenting a nicer, formatted error dialog (regression of DisplayCAL 3.1.7 instrument driver installer download related changes).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows, cosmetic): Reflect changed display resolution and position in UI (doesn't influence functionality).</li>
							<li>Resolve pattern generator: Unhandled exception if the system hostname could not be resolved to an IP address.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.7.3 </h3>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>0install (Linux): <code>(un)install-standalone-tools-icons</code> command was broken with 3.1 release.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Linux): Unhandled exception if oyranos-monitor is present (regression of late initialization change made in 3.1.7).</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

				<dt id="changelog-3.1.7.2">2016-10-21 12:26 (UTC) 3.1.7.2 </dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.7.2 </h3>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Windows: Toggling the “Load calibration on login” checkbox in the profile installation dialog now also toggles preserving calibration state in the profile loader and vice versa, thus actually affecting if calibration is loaded on login or not (this restores functionality that was lost with the initial DisplayCAL 3.1 release).</li>
							<li>Windows: The application, setup and Argyll USB driver installer executables are now digitally signed (starting from October 18, 2016 with SHA-1 digest for 3.1.7.1 and dual SHA-1 and SHA-256 digests for 3.1.7.2 from October 21, 2016).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): User-defined exceptions could be lost if exiting the profile loader followed by (re-)loading settings or restoring defaults in DisplayCAL.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

				<dt id="changelog-3.1.7.1">2016-10-18 10:00 (UTC) 3.1.7.1 </dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.7.1 </h3>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Setting calibration state to reset video card gamma tables overwrote cached gamma ramps for the 2nd display in a multi-display configuration.</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

				<dt id="changelog-3.1.7">2016-10-04 20:49 (UTC) 3.1.7 </dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.7 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>3D LUT sizes 5x5x5 and 9x9x9.</li>
							<li>JETI spectraval 1511/1501 support (requires Argyll CMS &gt;= 1.9).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): User-definable exceptions.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Added <code>reset-vcgt</code> scripting command (equivalent to selecting “Reset video card gamma table” from the popup menu).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>“Auto” resolution of PCS-to-device tables is now limited to 45x45x45 to prevent excessive processing times with profiles from “funky” measurements (i.e. due to bad/inaccurate instrument).</li>
							<li>Automatically optimized testcharts now use curves + matrix profiles for preconditioning to prevent a possible hang while creating the preconditioned testchart with LUT-type profiles from sufficiently “badly behaved” displays.</li>
							<li>2nd auto-optimized testchart slider step now defaults to XYZ LUT profile type as well, and the previous patch count was increased from 97 to 271 (necessary for baseline LUT profile accuracy).</li>
							<li>Adjusted curves + matrix testcharts to only include fully saturated RGB and grayscale to prevent tinted neutrals and/or “rollercoaster” curves on not-so-well behaved displays (also reduces testchart patch count and measurement time, but may worsen the resulting profile's overall accuracy).</li>
							<li>Removed near-black and near-white 1% grayscale increments from “video” verification charts.</li>
							<li>Use a 20 second timeout for unresponsive downloads.</li>
							<li>Windows: <strong>Much easier Argyll CMS instrument driver installation</strong> (for instruments that require it). No need to disable driver signature enforcement under Windows 8/10 anymore. Select “Install Argyll CMS instrument drivers...” from the “Tools” menu, click “Download &amp; install”, wait briefly for the download to finish (400 KB), confirm the User Access Control popup, done. Note that the driver installer executable is currently not digitally signed (obtaining a suitable certificate from a trusted authority is in progress), but the driver itself is signed as usual. The installer is based on <a href="https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi">libwdi</a>.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Changed <code>apply-profiles</code> scripting command to behave excatly like selecting “Load calibration from current display device profile(s)” from the popup menu, i.e. not only load calibration, but also change the setting.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Also count calibration state being (re)applied when the profile loader state or profile association(s) changes.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Update measurement modes after importing colorimeter corrections. Fixes additional measurement modes for the Spyder4/5 not appearing until the program is restarted or a different instrument is selected first.</li>
							<li>Trivial: Instrument setup was unnecessarily being called twice after downloading Argyll CMS when the latter wasn't previously detected.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: Work around a wxPython bug which prevents launching the application from a path containing non-ASCII characters.</li>
							<li>Mac OS X: Work around a configuration problem affecting Argyll CMS 1.9 and 1.9.1 (fixes Spyder2 firmware, additional Spyder4/5 measurement modes, and imported colorimeter corrections not being seen by DisplayCAL if imported via Argyll CMS 1.9 or 1.9.1).</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

				<dt id="changelog-3.1.6">2016-08-24 21:33 (UTC) 3.1.6 </dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.6 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>HDR/SMPTE 2084: Advanced options to specify maximum content light level for roll-off (use with care!) as well as content colorspace (affects perceptual intent gamut mapping, less so colorimetric).</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Increased timeout to launch Argyll CMS tools to 20 seconds.</li>
							<li>Show failed items when otherwise successfully importing colorimeter corrections, and detect updated CCSS files.</li>
							<li>HDR/SMPTE 2084: Improve overall saturation preservation.</li>
							<li>Linux/colord: When checking for a valid colord device ID, also try with manufacturer omitted.</li>
							<li>Windows Vista and later: Use “known folders” API to determine path to “Downloads” directory.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>HDR/SMPTE 2084: Slightly too light near-black tones when black output offset was set to below 100%.</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC Profile Creator: Undefined variable when creating synthetic profile with custom gamma or BT.1886 and non-zero black level (regression of HDR-related changes made in 3.1.5).</li>
							<li>When loading settings from a profile created with DisplayCAL prior to 3.1.5 and custom 3D LUT tone curve gamma in DisplayCAL 3.1.5, the gamma and output offset controls wouldn't be shown if advanced options weren't enabled until re-selecting the tone curve choice.</li>
							<li>Cosmetic (Windows 10): Banner would go blank under some Windows 10 configurations when showing the profile or 3D LUT installation dialog.</li>
							<li>Cosmetic (Linux): Missing backgrounds and wrongly sized combo boxes when wxGTK is built against GTK3.</li>
							<li>Linux: Profile loader autostart entry was installed under wrong (mixed-case) name if installing for the current user, which lead to the loader unnecesarily being run twice if DisplayCAL was installed from a RPM or DEB package. The superfluous loader entry will be automatically removed the next time you install a profile, or you can remove it manually by running <code>rm ~/.config/autostart/z-DisplayCAL-apply-profiles.desktop</code> in a terminal.</li>
							<li>Linux/colord: Don't cache device IDs that are not the result of a successful query.</li>
							<li>Windows: Make elevated subprocess calls synchronous. Fixes importing colorimeter corrections system-wide not listing all succesfully imported items on the first use.</li>
						</ul>

				<dt id="changelog-3.1.5">2016-08-02 22:28 (UTC) 3.1.5 </dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.5 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>HDR: Allow specifying of black output offset for SMPTE 2084.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>HDR: Implemented SMPTE 2084 rolloff according to ITU-R BT.2390.</li>
							<li>HDR: Implemented SMPTE 2084 3D LUT tone mapping (preserve hue and saturation with rolloff).</li>
							<li>HDR: Improved SMPTE 2084 3D LUT perceptual intent rendering (better preserve saturation). Note that colorimetric intent is recommended and will also do tone mapping.</li>
							<li>Linux/colord: Increase timeout when querying for newly installed profiles to 20 seconnds.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Minor: HDR peak luminance textbox was sometimes not able to receive focus.</li>
							<li>Minor (Mac OS X): Don't omit ICC files from compressed archives (regression of adding device link profiles as possible 3D LUT output format in DisplayCAL 3.1.3).</li>
						</ul>

				<dt id="changelog-3.1.4">2016-07-10 23:35 (UTC) 3.1.4 </dt>
					<dd>
						<h3>3.1.4 </h3>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>A fourth Rec. 709 encompassing color space variant as a profile connection space candidate for XYZ LUT profiles. May lead to better utilization of PCS-to-device color lookup table grid points in some cases (and thus potentially smaller profiles when the effective resolution is set to the default of “Auto”).</li>
							<li>An option to include legacy serial ports (if any) in detected instruments.</li>
							<li>SMPTE 2084 (HDR) as 3D LUT tone curve choice.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Don't preserve shaper curves in ICC device link profiles if selected as 3D LUT output format (effectively matching other 3D LUT formats).</li>
							<li>Removed “Prepress” preset due to large overlap with “Softproof”.</li>
							<li>Changed “Softproof” preset to use 5800K whitepoint target (in line with Fogra softproof handbook typical photography workflow suggested starting point value) and automatic black point hue correction.</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC profile creator: Changed SMPTE 2084 to always clip (optionally with roll-off) if peak white is below 10000 cd/m².</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC profile creator: Changed transition to specified black point of generated profiles to be consistent with BT.1886 black point blending (less gradual transition, blend over to specified black point considerably closer to black).</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): If no profile assigned, load implicit linear calibration.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>When loading settings from an existing profile, some CIECAM02 advanced profiling options were not recognized correctly.</li>
							<li>Don't accidentally remove the current display profile if Argyll CMS is older than version 1.1 or the Argyll CMS version is not included in the first line of output due to interference with QuickKeys under Mac OS X.</li>
							<li>Make sure the Argyll CMS version is detected even if it isn't contained in the first line of output (fixes Argyll CMS version not being detected if QuickKeys Input Manager is installed under Mac OS X).</li>
							<li>When loading settings, add 3D LUT input profile to selector if not yet present.</li>
							<li>Curve viewer/profile information: Fix potential division by zero error when graphing unusual curves (e.g. non-monotonic or with very harsh bends).</li>
							<li>Profile information: Reset right pane row background color on each profile load (fixes “named color” profile color swatches sticking even after loading a different profile).</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>3.1.3.1 </h3>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated traditional chinese localization (work-in-progress, thanks to 楊添明).</li>
							<li>Windows: If madTPG is set to fullscreen and there's more than one display connected, don't temporarily override fullscreen if interactive display adjustment is enabled.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Windows: If interactive display adjustment is disabled and madTPG is set to fullscreen, show instrument placement countdown messages in madTPG OSD.</li>
							<li>Windows: Restore madTPG fullscreen button state on disconnect if it was temporarily overridden.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Error message when right-clicking the profile loader task tray icon while DisplayCAL is running.</li>

						<h3>3.1.3 </h3>

						<p><strong>If you update from DisplayCAL 3.1/3.1.1/3.1.2 standalone under Windows using the installer</strong>, please close the profile loader manually (if it is running) before running setup - due to an unfortunate bug, the installer may not be able to close and restart the profile loader automatically, which may then require using the task manager to end the profile loader process. Apologies for the inconvenience.</p>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Device link profile as possible 3D LUT output format.</li>
							<li>French ReadMe (thanks to Jean-Luc Coulon).</li>
							<li>Partial traditional chinese localization (work-in-progress, thanks to 楊添明).</li>
							<li>When you change the language in DisplayCAL, the Windows Profile Loader will follow on-the-fly if running.</li>
							<li>Synthetic ICC profile creator: Capability to specify profile class, technology and colorimetric image state.</li>
							<li>Windows: When the display configuration is changed while DisplayCAL is running, automatically re-enumerate displays, and load calibration if using the profile loader.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows): Starting the loader with the <code>--oneshot</code> argument will make it exit after launching.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Updated ReShade 3D LUT installation instructions in the ReadMe.</li>
							<li>Improved “Enhance effective resolution of PCS to device tables” smoothing accuracy slightly.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows):
								<ul>
									<li>Detect CPKeeper (Color Profile Keeper) and HCFR.</li>
									<li>Show any calibration loading errors on startup or display/profile change in a notification popup, and also reflect this with a different icon.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Added semicolon (“;”) to disallowed profile name characters.</li>
							<li>ICC profile objects were leaking memory.</li>
							<li>Windows: Made sure that the virtual console size is not larger than the maximum allowed size (fixes possible inability to launch Argyll CMS tools on some systems if the Windows scaling factor was equal to or above 175%).</li>
							<li>Windows (Vista and newer): Use system-wide profiles if per-user profiles are disabled.</li>
							<li>Profile loader (Windows):
								<ul>
									<li>If Windows calibration management is enabled (not recommended!), correctly reflect the disabled state of the profile loader in the task tray icon and don't load calibration when launching the profile loader (but keep track of profile assignment changes).</li>
									<li>Prevent a race condition when “Fix profile associations automatically” is enabled and changing the display configuration, which could lead to wrong profile associations not being fixed.</li>
									<li>Sometimes the loader did not exit cleanly if using <code>taskkill</code> or similar external methods.</li>
									<li>Prevent a race condition where the loader could try to access a no longer available display device right after a display configuration change, which resulted in no longer being able to influence the calibration state (requiring a loader restart to fix).</li>
									<li>Profile loader not reacting to display changes under Windows XP.</li>
								</ul>

						<h3>3.1 </h3>

						<h4>dispcalGUI has been renamed to DisplayCAL.</h4>

						<p><strong>If you upgrade using 0install under Linux:</strong> It is recommended that you download the respective <a href="https://displaycal.net/#download">DisplayCAL-0install package</a> for your distribution and install it so that the applications accessible via the menu of your desktop environment are updated properly.</p>

						<p><strong>If you upgrade using 0install under Mac OS X:</strong> It is recommended that you delete existing dispcalGUI application icons, then download the <a href="https://displaycal.net/download/DisplayCAL-0install.dmg">DisplayCAL-0install.dmg</a> disk image to get updated applications.</p>

						<h4>Added in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Better HiDPI support.</strong> All text should now be crisp on HiDPI displays (with the exception of axis labels on curve and gamut graphs under Mac OS X). Icons will be scaled according to the scaling factor or DPI set in the display settings under Windows, or the respective (font) scaling or DPI system setting under Linux. Icons will be scaled down or up from their 2x version if a matching size is not available. Note that support for crisp icons in HiDPI mode is currently not available in the GTK3 and Mac OS X port of wxPython/wxWidgets. Also note that if you run a multi-monitor configuration, the application is system-DPI aware but not per-monitor-DPI aware, which is a limitation of wxPython/wxWidgets (under Windows, you will need to log out and back in after changing DPI settings for changes to take effect in DisplayCAL).</li>
							<li>When having created a compressed archive of a profile and related files, it can now also be imported back in via drag'n'drop or the “Load settings...” menu entry and respective button.</li>
							<li>Argyll CMS can be automatically downloaded and updated.</li>
							<li>A compressed logs archive can be created from the log window.</li>
							<li><strong>Windows: New profile loader.</strong> It will stay in the taskbar tray and automatically reload calibration if the display configuration changes or if the calibration is lost (although fullscreen Direct3D applications can still override the calibration). It can also automatically fix profile associations when switching from a multi-monitor configuration to a single display and vice versa (only under Vista and later). In addition, the profile loader is <a href="http://madvr.com/">madVR</a>-aware and will disable calibration loading if it detects e.g. madTPG or madVR being used by a video player.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Changed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Changed default calibration speed from “Medium” to “Fast”. Typically this cuts calibration time in half, while the accuracy difference is negligible at below 0.2 delta E.</li>
							<li>Enabled “Enhance effective resolution of PCS to device tables” and smoothing for L*a*b* LUT profiles.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Fixed in this release:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>In some cases, importing colorimeter corrections from the vendor software CD could fail (falling back to downloading them from the web).</li>
							<li>Moving the auto testchart patches slider to a value that changed the profile type did not update BPC accordingly (shaper+matrix defaults to BPC on).</li>
							<li>Minor: Safari/IE messed up positioning of CCT graph vertical axis labels in measurement reports.</li>
							<li>Minor: When clicking the “Install profile” button while not on the 3D LUT tab, and “Create 3D LUT after profiling” is enabled, don't create a 3D LUT.</li>
							<li>Minor: When changing profile type, only change the selected testchart if needed, and default to “Auto” for all profile types.</li>
							<li>Minor: 1st launch defaults were slightly different from what was intended (testchart should be “Auto”).</li>
							<li>Minor: Use OS line separator when writing configuration files.</li>
							<li>Linux: Text and icon sizes should be more consistent accross the application when the system text scaling or DPI has been adjusted (application restart required).</li>
							<li>Linux: Fall back to use the XrandR display name for colord device IDs if EDID is not available.</li>
							<li>Linux/Mac OS X: madVR test pattern generator interface was prone to connection failures due to a race condition. Also, verifying a madVR 3D LUT didn't work.</li>
