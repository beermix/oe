As an example, HD video material is usually mastered according to the Rec. 709 standard with either a pure power gamma of around 2.2-2.4 (relative with black output offset of 100%) or Rec. 1886 tone response curve (absolute with black output offset 0%). A split between Rec. 1886-like and pure power is also possible by setting black output offset to a value between 0% and 100%.\n\n<font weight='bold'>“Absolute” vs. “relative” gamma</font>\nTo accomodate a non-zero black level of a real display, the tone response curve needs to be offset and scaled accordingly.\n“Absolute” gamma results in an actual output at 50% input which doesn't match that of an idealized power curve (unless the black level is zero).\n“Relative” gamma results in an actual output at 50% input which matches that of an idealized power curve.\n\n<font weight='bold'>Rendering intent</font>\nIf you have calibrated to a different whitepoint than the one mandated by the source colorspace, and want to use that for the 3D LUT instead, select “Relative colorimetric”. Otherwise, select “Absolute colorimetric with white point scaling” (white point scaling will prevent clipping in absolute colorimetric mode that could happen if the source colorspace whitepoint is outside of the display gamut). You also have the option to use a non-colorimetric rendering intent that may compress or expand the source colorspace to fit within the display gamut (not recommended when colorimetric accuracy is required).",

Note that if during calibration you only want to adjust the display and skip the generation of 1D LUT curves, you need to set the tone response curve to “As measured”. 1D LUT calibration can <font weight='bold'>not</font> be used for full display color correction, you need to create a <font weight='bold'>ICC device profile</font> or <font weight='bold'>3D LUT</font> and use them with applications that support them for that purpose. 1D LUT calibration complements profiling and 3D LUT calibration though.",

For a reasonable quality 3x3 matrix and curves based profile, a few dozen patches can be enough if the display has good additive color mixing properties and linearity. Some professional displays fall into that category. If the highest possible accuracy is desired, a LUT-based profile from around several hundred up to several thousand patches is recommended. The <font weight='bold'>“Auto-optimized”</font> testchart setting automatically takes into account the non-linearities and actual response of the display, and should be used for best quality results.
