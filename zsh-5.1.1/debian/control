Description: architecture independent files for Zsh
 Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an
 interactive login shell and as a shell script command

 ksh but includes many enhancements. Zsh has command-line editing,
 built-in spelling correction, programmable command completion,
 shell functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and a
 host of other features.
