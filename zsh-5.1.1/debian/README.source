The Debian Zsh Package
======================

Debian's zsh package is team-maintained. This document describes some
of the resources the team uses.

Versioning Control System
-------------------------

The Debian Zsh Team uses a collab-maint Git repository on Alioth for
collaboratively maintaining the packaging code. The packaging lives in
the branch `debian`.

* Web-based repository viewer: https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/zsh.git
* Anonymous clone: `git clone -b debian git://anonscm.debian.org/collab-maint/zsh.git`
* Cloning via SSH: `git clone -b debian git.debian.org:/git/collab-maint/zsh.git`

The `master` branch in this Git repository is ancient and just exists
for historical reasons.

Workflow
--------

The workflow for working on the package is documented in
`debian/pkg-zsh-workflow.md`.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

After every push, zsh packages are built by the Jenkins instance at
http://jenkins.grml.org/view/Debian/.

### Jenkins-built zsh via APT

You can install the Jenkins-built zsh packages by adding the following
lines to your `sources.list`:

  deb     http://jenkins.grml.org/debian zsh main
  deb-src http://jenkins.grml.org/debian zsh main

You will need to import the GPG key of Grml's Jenkins instance into
APT. See http://jenkins.grml.org/view/Debian/job/zsh-binaries/ for
instructions and the current key id.

Communication
-------------

### IRC

Usually all active team members are gathered in #pkg-zsh on Freenode
(irc.freenode.net).

Feel free to join, but be patient when waiting for answers. May take a
couple of hours until someone answers -- depending on your timezone
and the current weekday.

The channel is bi-lingual English and German as (by coincidence) all
active team members have German as mother tongue. So feel free to ask
questions in German. We though usually switch to English if someone
joins the channel who doesn't speak German (well).

### Mailing Lists

The priamry mailing list is pkg-zsh-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org.

* Subscribe/unsubscribe at
  https://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pkg-zsh-devel
* Archive at https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-zsh-devel/

There's a secondary mailing list to which all git commits are sent to:
pkg-zsh-commits@lists.alioth.debian.org.

* Subscribe/unsubscribe at
  https://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pkg-zsh-commits
