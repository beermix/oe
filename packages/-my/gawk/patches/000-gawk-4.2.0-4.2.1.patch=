+I have disabled this compilation.
+
+* If you build GCC 4.2.4 and use that version of GCC, you can compile gawk
+with MPFR and the C99 settings.  But then the two readfile tests fail.
+The call to read(2) simply returns zero. I have no idea why.

+Subject: Re: gawk for OS/2 - any updates?
+
+Hello Arnold,
+
+I'd like to inform you about the current state of compiling gawk on
+OS/2:
+
+1. Compilation
+
+Running ./configure does work but
+
+- I tried only running with --disable-nls, so with NLS I didn't test.
+- Depending on the gcc version you use you may get linker errors. In
+  that case add 'CFLAGS=-O2 -g -fgnu89-inline' to the configure options
+  (-O2 -g already is the default).
+
+
+2. Tests
+
+It is possible to run the built-in checks but many test results depend
+on the shell being used. I recommend to use 'make -i check' to run
+the tests because some failures might cause a immediate termination
+of the make run.
+
+- If your shell uses \r\n linebreaks (in that case all tests fail)
+  then you have to run 'make -i check CMP=diff' to ignore the linebreak
+  differences at the test result comparison.
+- Depending on the shell some tests might just hang forever. Press
+  Ctrl+C and/or Ctrl+Break until the tests continue.
+- OS/2 can only load DLLs with filenames up to 8+3 bytes but gawk
+  creates three internal DLLs with longer names (e.g. filefuncs.dll,
+  revoutput.dll, revtwoway.dll). Thus, all tests trying to load
+  filefuncs.dll or the other two DLLs will fail. This is not a bug
+  of gawk. If you change e.g. the '@load filefuncs' directive to
+  '@load filefunc' in the according *.awk file then the tests will
+  succeed.
+- The number of failling tests is currently around 50, less if your
+  shell uses \r\n linebreaks, more otherwise.
+
+Best wishes,

-I apologize for the late response. Yes, OS/2 is still "alive" in some sense.
-At least, licenses are still sold but under the name "eComStation" (eCS)
-instead of OS/2. The (only) distributor is a small company "Serenity Systems",
-see www.ecomstation.com for details.

-So I would be pleased if you don't remove the code during the next years. :-)

-Thanks.

+.SH VARIABILI, RECORD E CAMPI
+Le variabili di \*(AK sono dinamiche; iniziano a esistere
+la prima volta che vengono usate.  I loro valori sono numeri in virgola
+mobile, o stringhe, o entrambe le cose, a seconda di come sono usati la prima volta.
+Inoltre,
+.I gawk
+consente di avere variabili di tipo "espressione regolare".
+\*(AK ha anche vettori monodimensionali; i vettori multidimensionali
+possono essere simulati [da vettori monodimensionali].
+.I Gawk
+fornisce veri vettori di vettori; vedere
+.BR Vettori ,
+pi avanti.  Al momento dell'esecuzione del programma sono impostate parecchie
+variabili predefinite; saranno descritte di volta in volta quando sar
+necessario, ed elencate pi avanti.
+.SS Record
+Normalmente i record sono separati dal carattere newline.  Si pu controllare il
+modo in cui i record sono separati assegnando valori alla variabile predefinita
+.BR RS .
+Se
+.B RS
+contiene un qualsiasi carattere singolo, tale carattere separa i record.
+Altrimenti, se
+.B RS
+ un'espressione regolare, il testo nell'input che corrisponde a questa
+espressione regolare sar il separatore di record.
+Tuttavia, nella modalit compatibile
+ preso in considerazione solo il primo carattere della stringa risultante,
+come separatore.
+Se
+.B RS
+contiene la stringa nulla, i record sono separati da righe vuote.
+Quando
+.B RS
+contiene la stringa nulla, il carattere newline ha sempre la funzione
+di separatore di campo in aggiunta a quello indicato dalla variabile
+.BR FS ,
+quale che esso sia.
+.SS Campi
+.PP
+Ogni volta che
+.I gawk
+legge un record lo spezza in
+.IR campi ,
+usando il valore della variabile
+.B FS
+come separatore di campo.
+Se
+.B FS
+ un carattere singolo, i campi sono separati da quel carattere.
+Se
+.B FS
+ la stringa nulla, ogni singolo carattere diventa un
+campo a s.
+Diversamente, si presume che
+.B FS
+sia un'espressione regolare
+completa.
+Nel caso particolare in cui
+.B FS
+sia un singolo spazio, i campi sono separati da sequenze di spazi, caratteri di
+tabulazione o newline.
+.BR NOTA :
+Il valore di
+.B IGNORECASE
+(vedi pi avanti) influenza anche il modo in cui i campi sono spezzati quando
+.B FS
+ un'espressione regolare, e come i record vengano separati quando
+.B RS
+ un'espressione regolare.
+.PP
+Se alla variabile
+.B FIELDWIDTHS

+Similmente, se alla variabile

+.PP
+La variabile
+.B NF
+contiene il numero di campi nel record in input.
+.PP
+Riferimenti a campi inesistenti (cio campi dopo

+producono la stringa vuota.  Tuttavia, l'assegnamento ad un campo inesistente
+(per esempio
+.BR "$(NF+2) = 5" )
+provoca l'incremento del valore di
+.BR NF ,
+crea tutti i campi intermedi assegnando loro la stringa nulla, e fa s
+che il valore di 
+.B $0
+sia ricalcolato utilizzando
+.B OFS
+per separare i campi.  Riferimenti a campi con indice negativo producono un
+errore fatale.  Il decremento di
+.B NF
+provoca la perdita dei campi di indice superiore al valore impostato, ed il
+ricalcolo di
+.BR $0 ,
+utilizzando
+.B OFS
+per separare i campi.
+.PP
+L'assegnamento di un valore a un campo esistente
+provoca la ricostruzione dell'intero record quando si faccia riferimento a

+l'indice del vettore  una stringa ottenuta concatenando
+i valori (stringa) di ogni espressione, separati dal valore della
+variabile
+.B SUBSEP .

+.fi
+.ft
+.RE
+.PP
+Se il vettore ha indici multipli, si usi
+.BR "(i, j) in vettore" .
+.PP
+Il costrutto
+.B in
+pu anche essere usato in un ciclo
+.B for
+per iterare su tutti gli elementi di un vettore.
+Comunque,  il costrutto
+.B "(i, j) in vettore"
+funziona solo nelle verifiche, non nei cicli
+.BR for .
+.PP
+Un elemento di un vettore pu essere cancellato con l'istruzione
+.BR delete .
+L'istruzione
+.B delete
+pu anche essere usata per cancellare l'intero contenuto di un vettore,
+basta specificare il nome del vettore stesso senza indici.
+.PP
+.I gawk
+supporta veri vettori multidimensionali.  Non richiede che
+tali vettori siano ``rettangolare'' come in C or C++.
+Per esempio:
+.sp
+.RS
+.ft B
+.nf
+a[1] = 5
+a[2][1] = 6
+a[2][2] = 7
+.fi
+.ft
+.RE
+.PP
+.BR NOTA :
+Si potrebbe aver necessit di dire a
+.I gawk
+che un elemento di un vettore  in realt un sottovettore per usarlo dove
+.I gawk
+si aspetta di trovare un vettore (come nel secondo argomento di
+.BR split() ).
+Si pu fare questo creando un elemento nel sottovettore e cancellandolo
+poi con l'istruzione
+.B delete .
+.SS Notazione e conversione delle variabili
+.PP
+Le variabili e i campi
+possono essere numeri (in virgola mobile), stringhe, o entrambe le cose.
+Possono anche essere espressioni regolari.
+Come sia interpretato il valore di una variabile dipende dal contesto.
+In un'espressione numerica, sar trattato come un numero; usato come
+stringa, sar trattato come tale.
+.PP
+Per far trattare una variabile come numero, le si sommi zero; per ottenere
+che venga trattata come come stringa, le si concateni la stringa nulla.
+.PP
+Le variabili non inizializzate hanno sia il valore numerico zero che il
+valore di stringa "" (la stringa nulla, o vuota).
+.PP
+Quando una stringa deve essere convertita in un numero, la conversione
+ compiuta con
+.IR strtod (3).
+I numeri sono convertiti a stringhe usando
+.IR sprintf (3)
+col valore di
+.B CONVFMT
+come stringa di formato
+ed il valore numerico della variabile come argomento.
+Tuttavia, anche se tutti i numeri in \*(AK sono in virgola mobile ("float"),
+i valori privi di decimali sono
+.I sempre
+convertiti in numeri interi.  Cos, dati
+.PP
+.RS
+.ft B
+.nf
+CONVFMT = "%2.2f"
+a = 12
+b = a ""
+.fi
+.ft R
+.RE
+.PP
+la variabile
+.B b
+ha un valore di tipo stringa di \fB"12"\fR e non \fB"12.00"\fR.
+.PP
+.BR NOTA :
+Quando si opera in modalit POSIX (come con l'opzione
+.BR \-\^\-posix ),
+bisogna fare attenzione che le impostazioni per la localizzazione possono
+interferire col modo in cui sono trattati i numeri decimali: il separatore
+decimale dei numeri che si forniscono a
+.I gawk
+deve essere conforme a quello che si aspetta la localizzazione in uso, che sia
+un punto (.) o una virgola (,).
+
+.I Gawk
+esegue i confronti nel modo seguente:
+Se due variabili sono numeriche, sono confrontate numericamente.
+Se una  numerica e l'altra  una stringa interpretabile come
+\*(lqstringa numerica,\*(rq
+sono pure confrontate numericamente.
+Negli altri casi, gli eventuali valori numerici sono convertiti in stringhe,
+ed  eseguito un confronto tra stringhe.
+Ovviamente, due stringhe sono confrontate come stringhe.
+.PP
+Si noti che le costanti stringa, come \fB"57"\fP,
+.I non
+sono stringhe numeriche, ma solo costanti stringa.  L'idea
+di \*(lqstringa numerica\*(rq si applica solo ai campi,
+all'input di
+.BR getline ,
+a
+.BR FILENAME ,
+agli elementi di
+.B ARGV
+di
+.B ENVIRON ,
+ed agli elementi di un vettore creato da
+.B split()
+o da
+.B patsplit()
+che abbiano le caratteristiche di una stringa numerica.
+L'idea fondamentale  che i dati
+.IR "immessi dall'utente" ,
+e solo essi, se risultano essere numerici,
+saranno trattati come numeri.
+.SS Costanti ottali ed esadecimali
+Nel codice sorgente del programma si possono usare costanti ottali ed
+esadecimali in stile C.
+Per esempio, il valore ottale
+.B 011
+ uguale al decimale
+.BR 9 ,
+e il valore esadecimale
+.B 0x11
+ uguale al decimale 17.
+.SS Costanti di tipo stringa
+.PP
+Le costanti stringa in \*(AK sono sequenze di caratteri racchiusi tra
+doppi apici (come \fB"valore"\fR).  All'interno delle stringhe, sono riconosciute alcune
+.IR "sequenze di protezione" ,
+come in in C.  Queste sono:
+.PP
+.TP "\w'\fB\e\^\fIddd\fR'u+1n"
+.B \e\e
+Una barra inversa letterale.
+.TP
+.B \ea
+Il carattere \*(lqalert\*(rq; in genere il carattere \s-1ASCII\s+1 \s-1BEL\s+1.
+.TP
+.B \eb
+Tasto di cancellazione all'indietro (backspace).
+.TP
+.B \ef
+Salto pagina (form-feed).

+Ritorno carrello (CR).
+.TP
+.B \et
+Tabulazione orizzontale.
+.TP
+.B \ev
+Tabulazione verticale.
+.TP
+.BI \ex "\^cifre_esa"
+Il carattere rappresentato dalla stringa di cifre esadecimali
+dopo la
+.BR \ex .
+Fino a due
+cifre esadecimali che seguono sono considerate parte
+della sequenza di protezione.
+Per esempio, \fB"\ex1B"\fR  il carattere \s-1ASCII\s+1 \s-1ESC\s+1 (escape).
+.TP
+.BI \e ddd
+Il carattere rappresentato da una sequenza di 3 cifre ottali.
+Per esempio, \fB"\e033"\fR  il carattere \s-1ASCII\s+1 \s-1ESC\s+1 (escape).
+.TP
+.BI \e c
+Il carattere letterale
+.IR c\^ .
+.PP
+In modalit compatibile, i caratteri rappresentati da sequenze di protezione
+ottali ed esadecimali sono trattati letteralmente, se usati in costanti
+costituite da espressioni regolari.  Cos,
+.B /a\e52b/
+ equivalente a
+.BR /a\e*b/ .
+.SS "Costanti di tipo Regexp"
+Una costante di tipo espressione regolare  una sequenza di caratteri
+racchiusa tra barre (come
+.BR /valore/ ).
+Come stabilire una corrispondenza con un'espressione regolare 
+descritto in maniera pi dettagliata pi avanti; vedere
+.BR "Espressioni regolari" .
+.PP
+Le sequenze di protezione descritte sopra si possono usare anche
+all'interno di costanti che sono espressioni regolari
+(p.es.,
+.B "/[\ \et\ef\en\er\ev]/"
+corrisponde a tutti i caratteri non stampabili [bianchi]).
+.TP
+.I Gawk
+consente anche di usare costanti formate da espressioni regolari
+.IR "fortemente tipizzate" .
+I nome di tali costanti sono preceduti da un simbolo
+.B @
+(cos:
+.BR @/valore/ ).
+Queste costanti possono essere assegnare a scalari (variabili,
+elementi di un vettore) e passate a funzione definite dall'utente.
+Le variabili il cui valore  stato assegnato in questo modo
+hanno come tipo quello di variabili di espressioni regolari.
+.SH CRITERI DI RICERCA E AZIONI
+\*(AK  un linguaggio che procede per righe.  Il criterio va a inizio riga,
+l'azione lo segue.  Le istruzioni dell'azione sono racchiuse tra

+.RE
+.PP
+ossia stampare l'intero record.
+.PP
+I commenti cominciano col carattere

+.BR ? ,
+.BR : ,
+.BR && ,

+.PP
+Le 
+.I "classi di caratteri"
+sono una nuova funzionalit introdotta nello standard \*(PX.  Una classe di
+caratteri  una speciale notazione per indicare liste di caratteri accomunati
+da uno specifico attributo, dove per i caratteri veri e propri possono variare
+a seconda della nazione e del set di caratteri.  Per esempio, la nozione di
+"carattere alfabetico" valida negli Stati Uniti  diversa da quella valida in
+Francia.
+.PP
+Una classe di caratteri  ammessa solo
+.I all'interno
+delle parentesi quadre di una lista di caratteri di una espressione regolare.
+Le classi di caratteri si rappresentano con
+.BR [: ,
+una parola chiave indicante la classe, e
+.BR :] .
+Queste sono le classi di caratteri definite dallo standard \*(PX:
+.TP "\w'\fB[:alnum:]\fR'u+2n"
+.B [:alnum:]
+Caratteri alfanumerici.
+.TP
+.B [:alpha:]
+Caratteri alfabetici.
+.TP
+.B [:blank:]
+Caratteri "spazio" e "tab".
+.TP
+.B [:cntrl:]
+Caratteri di controllo.
+.TP
+.B [:digit:]
+Caratteri numerici.
+.TP
+.B [:graph:]
+Caratteri che siano sia stampabili che visibili
+(uno spazio  stampabile ma non visibile, mentre
+.B a
+ entrambe le cose).
+.TP
+.B [:lower:]
+Caratteri alfabetici minuscoli.
+.TP
+.B [:print:]
+Caratteri stampabili (cio caratteri che non siano di controllo).
+.TP
+.B [:punct:]
+Caratteri di punteggiatura (cio caratteri che non siano n lettere,
+n cifre, n caratteri di controllo, n caratteri di spaziatura).
+.TP
+.B [:space:]
+Caratteri di spaziatura (come lo spazio, "tab", "formfeed", per citarne solo
+alcuni).
+.TP
+.B [:upper:]
+Caratteri alfabetici maiuscoli.
+.TP
+.B [:xdigit:]
+Cifre esadecimali.
+.PP
+Per fare un esempio, prima dell'introduzione dello standard \*(PX
+si sarebbe dovuto scrivere
+.B /[A\-Za\-z0\-9]/
+per individuare caratteri alfanumerici.  Qualora il set di caratteri vigente
+avesse compreso altri caratteri alfanumerici, l'espressione non li avrebbe
+riconosciuti, e se il set di caratteri fosse rappresentato in modo diverso da
+\s-1ASCII\s+1, non sarebbero riconosciuti neanche i caratteri alfanumerici
+\s-1ASCII\s+1.
+Con le classi di caratteri \*(PX, si pu scrivere
+.BR /[[:alnum:]]/ ,
+che trover corrispondenza con
+i caratteri alfabetici e numerici previsti dal set di caratteri in uso,
+qualunque esso sia.
+.PP
+Nelle liste di caratteri possono comparire due sequenze speciali
+aggiuntive. Esse si applicano ai set di caratteri non \s-1ASCII\s+1, i quali
+possono comprendere sia simboli singoli (chiamati
+.IR "elementi di collazione" )
+rappresentati da pi di un carattere, sia
+gruppi di caratteri tra loro equivalenti ai fini della
+.I collazione
+o dell'ordinamento.
+Per esempio, in francese una \*(lqe\*(rq semplice ed una
+\*(lqe"\h'-\w:e:u'\`\*(rq con l'accento grave sono equivalenti.
+.TP
+Simboli di collazione
+Un simbolo di collazione  un elemento di confronto costituito da pi
+di un carattere racchiuso tra
+.B [.
+e
+.BR .] .
+Per esempio, se
+.B ch
+ un elemento di collazione, allora
+.B [[.ch.]]
+ l'espressione regolare che lo individua, mentre
+.B [ch]
+ un'espressione regolare che individua o il carattere
+.B c
+o il carattere
+.BR h .
+.TP
+Classi di Equivalenza
+Una classe di equivalenza  un nome, dipendente dalla localizzazione, associato
+a una lista di caratteri tra loro equivalenti.  Il nome  racchiuso tra
+.B [=
+e
+.BR =] .
+Per esempio, il nome
+.B e
+potrebbe essere usato per rappresentare globalmente i caratteri
+\*(lqe\*(rq, \*(lqe\h'-\w:e:u'\'\*(rq, ed \*(lqe\h'-\w:e:u'\`\*(rq.
+In questo caso,
+.B [[=e]]
+ un'espressione regolare compatibile con uno qualsiasi dei caratteri
+.BR e ,
+.BR  ,
+ed
+.BR  .

+Parecchi passi sono necessari per produrre ed eseguire un programma \*(AK
+localizzabile.
+.TP "\w'4.'u+2n"
+1.
+Aggiungere un'azione
+.B BEGIN
+per assegnare un valore alla variabile
+.B TEXTDOMAIN
+per impostare il dominio del testo a un nome associato al programma in uso:
+.sp
+.in +5m
+.ft B
+BEGIN { TEXTDOMAIN = "mio_programma" }
+.ft R
+.in -5m
+.sp
+Ci consente a

+di trovare il file

+associato al vostro programma.
+Se non si fa ci,

+usa il dominio di testo associato ai

+il quale, molto probabilmente, non contiene
+le traduzioni necessarie al programma in uso.
+.TP
+2.
+Far precedere a tutte le stringhe da tradurre il carattere "_".
+.TP
+3.
+Se  il caso, usare le funzioni
+.B dcgettext()
+e/o
+.B bindtextdomain()
+nel programma, secondo necessit.
+.TP
+4.
+Eseguite il comando
+.B "gawk \-\^\-gen\-pot \-f mio_programma.awk > mio_programma.pot"
+per generare un file
+.B \&.pot
+per il programma [questo file contiene i messaggi da tradurre e la
+struttura in cui inserire la traduzione]
+.TP
+5.
+Preparare delle traduzioni appropriate dei messaggi, e costruire [con make]
+il corrispondente file
+.B \&.gmo
+[che contiene messaggi e traduzioni in formato accessibile da gawk].
+.PP
+Le procedure da usare per la traduzione sono descritte in dettaglio in \*(EP.
+.SH COMPATIBILIT POSIX
+Un obiettivo fondamentale di
+.I gawk
+ la compatibilit con lo standard \*(PX, come pure con
+l'ultima versione di
+.IR awk
+scritta da Brian Kernighan.
+Per questa ragione
+.I gawk
+include le seguenti caratteristiche a disposizione dell'utente
+che non sono descritte nel libro di \*(AK,
+ma che fanno parte della versione di
+.I awk
+scritta da Brian Kernighan, e che sono incluse nello standard \*(PX.
+.PP
+Il libro indica che l'assegnazione delle variabili fornite sulla riga di
+comando  fatta subito prima che
+.I awk
+apra il primo file fra gli argomenti, il che avviene dopo che la
+regola
+.B BEGIN
+ stata eseguita.  Peraltro, in implementazioni precedenti, quando una tale
+assegnazione compariva prima di un nome di file, l'assegnazione sarebbe
+avvenuta 
+.I prima
+di eseguire la regola
+.B BEGIN .
+Esistono applicazioni che dipendono da questa \*(lqfunzionalit.\*(rq
+Quando
+.I awk
+ stato cambiato per corrispondere alla sua documentazione l'opzione
+.B \-v
+per assegnare valori alle variabili prima dell'inizio dell'esecuzione  stata aggiunta
+per tener conto delle applicazioni che dipendevano dal precedente comportamento.
+(Questa funzionalit ha ottenuto l'approvazione sia dei Bell Laboratories
+che degli sviluppatori di \*(GN .)
+.PP
+Nella scansione degli argomenti,
+.I gawk
+usa l'opzione speciale \*(lq\-\^\-\*(rq per segnalare la fine degli
+argomenti.
+In modalit compatibile, emette un messaggio e poi ignora le
+opzioni non disponibili.
+Nella modalit normale di operazione, siffatti argomenti sono passati al programma \*(AK
+per essere trattati.
+.PP
+Il libro di \*(AK non definisce il valore restituito dalla funzione
+.BR srand() .
+Lo standard \*(PX
+richiede che restituisca il "seme" che  stato usato, per consentire di tener traccia
+delle sequenze di numeri casuali.  Pertanto
+.B srand()
+in
+.I gawk
+restituisce anche il suo "seme" corrente.
+.PP
+Altre funzionalit sono:
+L'uso di opzioni
+.B \-f
+multiple (dalla versione MKS [Mortice Kern Systems] di
+.IR awk );
+il vettore
+.BR ENVIRON ;
+le sequenze di protezione
+.BR \ea ,
+e
+.B \ev
+(provenienti originalmente da
+.I gawk
+e poi riversate nella versione Bell Laboratories); le funzioni predefinite
+.B tolower()
+e
+.B toupper()
+(dalla versione Bell Laboratories); e le specifiche di conversione ISO C in
+.B printf
+(presenti per prime nella versione Bell Laboratories).
+.SH FUNZIONALIT STORICHE
+C' una caratteristica dell'implementazione storica di \*(AK che
+.I gawk
+supporta:
+ possibile chiamare la funzione predefinita
+.B length()
+non solo senza alcun argomento, ma perfino senza parentesi!
+Quindi,
+.RS
+.PP
+.ft B
+a = length	# Sant'Algol 60, Batman!
+.ft R
+.RE
+.PP
+equivale sia a
+.RS
+.PP
+.ft B
+a = length()
+.br
+a = length($0)
+.ft R
+.RE
+.PP
+Usare questa funzionalit  una pratica deprecata, e
+.I gawk
+emette un messaggio di avvertimento se la si usa, qualora si sia specificato
+.B \-\^\-lint
+sulla riga di comando.
+.SH ESTENSIONI GNU
+.I Gawk
+ha fin troppe estensioni rispetto alla versione \*(PX di
+.IR awk .
+Esse sono descritte in questa sezione.  Tutte le estensioni qui descritte
+possono essere disabilitate
+invocando
+.I gawk
+con le opzioni

+.SH SEGNALAZIONE DI ERRORI
+Se trovate un bug in
+.IR gawk ,
+siete pregati di inviare un messaggio di posta elettronica a
+.BR bug-gawk@gnu.org .
+Siete pregati di includere il vostro sistema operativo e la versione di
+.I gawk
+(da
+.BR "gawk \-\^\-version" ),
+quale compilatore C avete usato per compilarlo, e un programma di test
+con anche i dati, ridotti allo stretto necessario, per riprodurre il problema.
+.PP
+Prima di spedire un rapporto di errore fate quanto segue.  Per prima cosa,
+verificate che stiate usando l'ultima versione di
+.IR gawk .
+Molti bug (normalmente abbastanza difficili da incontrare) sono corretti in
+ogni nuova versione, e se la vostra versione  molto datata, il problema
+potrebbe essere gi stato risolto.  Secondariamente, siete pregati di
+controllare se impostando la variabile d'ambiente
+.B LC_ALL
+a
+.B LC_ALL=C
+faccia s che il problema scompaia.  Se cos , si tratta di un problema
+legato alla localizzazione, che pu essere o meno un errore.
+Infine, siete pregati di leggere questa man page e il manuale di riferimento
+con attenzione, per assicurarvi che quello che voi ritenete essere un errore
+lo sia veramente, invece di essere solo un comportamento strano del linguaggio.
+.PP
+Qualsiasi cosa facciate,
+.B NON
+inviate un messaggio per segnalare l'errore a
+.BR comp.lang.awk .
+Anche se gli sviluppatori di
+.I gawk
+di tanto in tanto leggono questo forum, inviare qui messaggi di segnalazione
+di errore  una maniera poco affidabile per segnalare errori.  Siete invece
+pregati di usare l'indirizzo di posta elettronica scritto pi sopra.
+Veramente!
+.PP
+Se state usando un sistema GNU/Linux o basato sulla distribuzione BSD,
+potreste rivolgervi a chi fornisce la vostra distribuzione software.
+Questo va bene, ma siete pregati di spedire una copia all'indirizzo email
+specificato, poich non esiste alcune certezza che il vostro messaggio
+sia inoltrato al manutentore di
+.IR gawk .
+.PP
+Segnalare eventuali errori di traduzione a

+	* configure.ac (pkgextensiondir): This must be set to
+	'${libdir}/gawk'${EXTENSIONDIR} to match gawk's value.
+	The previous value of '${pkglibdir}'${EXTENSIONDIR} was incorrect,
+	because it was putting the extensions in the gawk-extensions
+	libdir subdirectory, instead of the gawk subdirectory.

+	* configure.ac (AC_HEADER_MAJOR): Comment out, no longer works.

+2018-02-07         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>
+
+	* Makefile.am (uplus, mpfruplus): Add new tests.
+	* uplus.awk, uplus.ok, mpfruplus.ok: New files.
+
+2018-02-05         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@skeeve.com>
+
+	* Makefile.am (MPFR_TESTS): Sort tests and use backslash
+	continuation to get the full list. A HUGE thank you to
+	Eli Zaretskii <eliz@gnu.org> for the report.
+
+2018-02-01         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@skeeve.com>
+
+	* Makefile.am (AWK): Move LANGUAGE= to here instead of
+	having it in individual tests.
+
+2018-01-24         John E. Malmberg      <wb8tyw@qsl.net>
+
+	* lintold.awk: Minor change to allow test to run on
+	32 bit VAX/VMS with out a floating overflow.
+
+2018-01-18         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@skeeve.com>
+
+	* Makefile.am (pty2): Instead of sed, use simpler awk goop
+	to canonicalize the output from od. Thanks to Michal
+	Jaegermann for the tip.
+	* pty2.ok: Updated.
+
+2018-01-17         Arnold D. Robbins     <arnold@skeeve.com>
+
+	* Makefile.am (charset-tests-all): Add punctuation in the message.
+	(charset-msg-start): Add fr_FR.UTF-8 to list of desired locales,
+	reformat the message.
+	(isarrayunset): New test.
+	* isarrayunset.awk, isarrayunset.ok: New files.
+	* pty2: Add some sed goop to canonicalize the output of od;
+	this works around the Mac OS X od which produces different
+	output, avoiding a spurious test failure.
