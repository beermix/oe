Description: Inhibit example code extraction
 The Debian bison package cannot extract example code from info
 documentation because said documentation is moved into the
 bison-doc pacakge due to DFSG non-compliance.  Leaving
 example code extraction in the build process breaks parallel
 builds, so this patch is necessary to make parallel builds work.
