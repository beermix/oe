Description: tolerate ipxe size change on migrations to >=18.04

Older IPXE roms were smaller, but just changing this size on ipxe upgrades
breaks migration and save/restore as the PCI bar sizes are not allowed to
change.

This is essentially a per Distribution release detail depending
on which ipxe roms (and which options, builds) are bundled with an qemu.
To fix migrations define a compat for anything older than the bump of the
rom size and map older machine types to filenames. We can then provide
compat-roms (old or built differently) for those.

We only support the defaults for migrations (shutdown, move, start and
essentially everything that does a full restart/init works without this
indirection), so only map those whose default rom was on the efi-* roms
that existed and now crossed 256k.
