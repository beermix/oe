Description: X Window System utility programs for development
 xutils-dev provides a set of utility programs shipped with the X Window System

 even on a system that does not have any X clients or X servers installed.
 .
 The programs in this package include:
  - imake, a C preprocessor interface to the make utility;
  - lndir, a tool that creates a shadow directory of symbolic links to
    another directory tree;
  - makedepend, a tool to create dependencies in makefiles;
  - makeg, a tool for making debuggable executables.
 .
 This package also contains xorg-macros.m4, a set of macros used in configure
 scripts of X.Org packages.
