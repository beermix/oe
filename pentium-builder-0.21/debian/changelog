pentium-builder (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge NMU, thanks Amaya Rodrigo Sastre (Closes: #359560, #169159).

pentium-builder (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Horrible bug: the pentium-builder scripts fail silently and indicate
    success to the parent process if they are unable to execute the real
    compiler. Execution can fail due to a variety of temporary or
    permanent problems. In the case of pentium-builder, the chief problem
    was calling a binary that wasn't there. pentium-builder now prints a
    diagnostic and terminates with a non-zero exit code if execution
    fails. Thanks Francesco Potorti`. (closes: Bug#151077)
  * Updated copyright.

pentium-builder (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Acknowledge NMU, thanks Junichi Uekawa. (closes: Bug#126243)
  * Cleaned up man pages.

 -- Alex Pennace <alex@pennace.org>  Sat,  2 Mar 2002 16:14:44 -0500

pentium-builder (0.16.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU at the request of maintainer.
  * merging athlon-builder to pentium-builder (closes: #122488, #95393)

 -- Junichi Uekawa <dancer@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Dec 2001 15:04:24 +0900

pentium-builder (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed --print-libgcc-file-name kludge because it causes problems
    when used as input to 'gcc -E'. (closes: Bug#106727)

 -- Alex Pennace <alex@pennace.org>  Tue, 31 Jul 2001 00:51:16 -0400

pentium-builder (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer. (closes: Bug#100372)
  * Fixed --print-libgcc-file-name kludge. Note that 'dpkg
    --print-architecture' warns about the strange gcc output but otherwise
    behaves as expected, and dpkg-architecture will return i386. This may
    cause other problems. (closes: Bug#92325)
  * Arranged for proper Perl dependency with dh_perl.
  * Changed debhelper build dependency from Build-Depends-Indep to
    Build-Depends, since dh_testdir is called from the build target in
    debian/rules, see Debian Policy Manual ver. 3.5.5.0 sec. 7.6.
  * Added dependency on 'gcc | g++'; the package is useless without either
    of those packages.
  * Added basic manual pages for builder-cc and builder-c++.
  * New copyright file.
  * Complies with Debian Policy ver. 3.5.5.0; updated Standards-Version
    control field accordingly.

 -- Alex Pennace <alex@pennace.org>  Sun, 15 Jul 2001 21:34:07 -0400

pentium-builder (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  7 Feb 2000 13:55:05 -0800

pentium-builder (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * I think this fixes an upgrade problem where dpkg-divert would not remove
    the c++ diversion because there was a file there. Closes: #54618
  * Fixed typo that broke g++, Closes: #54992

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Jan 2000 18:06:04 -0800

pentium-builder (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Mar 1999 20:37:59 -0800

pentium-builder (0.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fixed gcc wrapper so it will work if passed things like -Dfoo="bar baz"

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Mar 1999 16:49:56 -0800

pentium-builder (0.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Now uses an enviroment variable DPKG_BUILDARCH, instead of
    DPKG_OPTIMIZATION.
  * Now intercepts dpkg's call to gcc --print-libgcc-file-name and 
    munges the result so dpkg builds a package in the wanted architecture.
  * Use -mcpu= and -march=, instead of just -m.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Jul 1998 16:44:09 -0700

pentium-builder (0.1) experimental; urgency=low
